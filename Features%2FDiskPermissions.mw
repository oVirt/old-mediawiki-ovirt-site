== Disk Permissions ==

=== Summary ===
The Disk Permissions feature is supplementary for Disk related features (Floating Disk, Shared Raw Disk, Direct LUN). It enables permissions management on a Disk.

* Email: masayag@redhat.com

=== Current status ===
* Status: Design Stage 
* Last updated date: Wed Mar 13 2012

=== Design ===
Disk inherits permissions from the VM it is attached to and from the storage domain he resides on (if there is one) <BR>
The following section describes permissions for Disk entities.

==== Disk Actions ====
Required permissions for Disk related actions:
* Create disk - requires permissions on the Storage Domain, (can't assume Quota is sufficient to permit user creating the disk on the Storage Domain, as Quota might be disabled).
* Attach disk to VM - requires permissions on the Disk and on the VM (applies for shared disk as well).
* Detach disk from VM - requires permissions on the VM only. (Unlike attach disk that requires permissions on the VM and on the Disk).
* Activate/Deactivate disk on VM (also Hot Plug) - requires permission on the VM.
* Remove disk - permissions on the Disk.
* Move or copy disk - requires permissions on the Disk and on the target Storage Domain.
* Add disk to VM - requires both permissions on the VM and on the storage domain (same as adding disk and attaching to VM).
** Create - on storage domain
** Attach - on disk and VM
** Activate - on VM
* Remove VM - we'll extend the command to support either deleting disks from the system (the current behaviour) or only detach the disks, permissions goes as follows:
** If disks are marked for deletion, requires permissions on the removed Disks and on the VM.
** If disks aren't marked for deletion, the disks are detached, therefore no permissions required for the Disk, only for removing VM.

==== Roles ====
===== New Roles =====
New predefined role for disks DISK_OPERATOR should be given to user when creating a Disk.
  Add new role to ''PredefinedRoles.java''
  Add new role to ''backend/manager/dbscripts/insert_predefined_roles.sql''
  Add upgrade script to update role name

===== Updated Roles =====
VM Operator should be extended with permissions on Disk (attach/detach Disk, activate/deactivate Disk).
  Existing roles are Update by upgrade script.
  Extend ''VdcObjectType'' with Disk.

==== DB Changes ====
  Add support for Disk to ''fn_get_entity_parents'' stored-procedure.

==== UI Changes ====
  Add Disk Operator role to Roles Tree in:<BR>
  ''frontend/webadmin/modules/uicommonweb/src/main/java/org/ovirt/engine/ui/uicommonweb/models/configure/roles_ui/RoleTreeView.java''

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Permission management for Disks enhances the Disk functionality, provides flexibility to users and protects it from misuse.<BR>
Granting permissions on Disk to user is done via the Administrator Portal or using RESTful API.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
The Disk Permissions is dependent on the following features:
* SharedRawDisk
* Floating Disk
* Direct LUN

Affected oVirt projects:
* Engine-core
* Admin Portal

=== Open issues ===
* DB Upgrade should add ownership for the Disks by the VM users.
* Direct LUN - Add/Remove/Move(?) Direct LUN disk has its own commands or share the same Disk Add/Remove ? If share, need to distinguish the required permission by the Disk in the ''CommandBase.getPermissionCheckSubjects''
