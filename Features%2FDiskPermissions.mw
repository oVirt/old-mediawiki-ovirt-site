== Disk Permissions ==

=== Summary ===
The Disk Permissions feature is supplementary for Disk related features (Floating Disk, Shared Raw Disk, Direct LUN). It enables permissions management on a Disk.

=== Owner ===
* Name: Moti Asayag
* Email: masayag@redhat.com

=== Current status ===
* Status: Design Stage 
* Last updated date: Wed Mar 13 2012

=== Detailed Description ===
Disk should be located in entities hierarchy under storage domain and under VM.

=== Design ===
The following section describes permissions for Disk entities.

==== Disk Actions ====
Floating disk requires permission for Storage domain if lives inside a storage domain, else if disk is Direct LUN it requires permission for System.<BR>
Required permissions for Disk related actions:
* Create disk - requires Storage Domain permissions, (can't assume Quota is sufficient to permit user creating the disk on the Storage Domain, as Quota might be disabled).
* Attach disk to VM - requires permissions for the Disk and for the VM (applies for shared disk as well).
* Detach disk from VM - requires permissions on the VM only. (Unlike attach disk that requires permissions for the VM and for the Disk).
* Activate/Deactivate disk on VM (also Hot Plug) - requires permission for the VM.
* Remove disk - permissions for the Disk.
* Move or copy disk - requires permissions for the source Disk and for the target Storage Domain.
* Add disk to VM - requires both permissions for the VM and for the Disk to be added.
** Create - for storage domain
** Attach - for disk and VM
** Activate - for VM
* Remove VM - could be set to remove the VM and its Disks:
** If disks are marked for deletion, requires permissions on the removed Disks.
** If disks aren't marked for deletion, the disks are detached, therefore no permissions required for the Disk.

==== Roles ====
===== New Roles =====
New predefined role for disks should be added: DISK_OPERATOR. Should be given to user when creating a Disk.
* Add new role to PredefinedRoles.java
* Add new role to backend/manager/dbscripts/insert_predefined_roles.sql
* Add upgrade script to update role name

===== Updated Roles =====
VM Operator should be extended with permissions on Disk when attaching Disk to VM.
Existing roles are Update by upgrade script.
 
==== New action group ====
Extend VdcObjectType with Disk.

==== DB Changes ====
Add support for Disk for '''fn_get_entity_parents''' stored-procedure.

==== UI Changes ====
Add roles to RoleTreeView.initTreeView() (frontend/webadmin/modules/uicommonweb/src/main/java/org/ovirt/engine/ui/uicommonweb/models/configure/roles_ui/RoleTreeView.java)

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Permission management for Disks enhances the Disk functionality, provides flexibility to users and protects it from misuse.
Granting permissions on Disk to user is done via the Administrator Portal or using RESTful API.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
The Disk Permissions is dependent on the following features:
* SharedRawDisk
* Floating Disk
* Direct LUN

Affected oVirt projects:
* API
* CLI
* Engine-core
* Admin Portal
* User Portal

=== Open issues ===
* DB Upgrade should add ownership for the Disks by the VM users.
