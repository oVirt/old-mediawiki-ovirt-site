== NUMA and Virtual NUMA ==

=== Summary ===
The hypervisorâ€™s default policy is to schedule and run the guest on any available resources on the host. As a result, the resources backing a given guest could end up getting spread out across multiple NUMA nodes and over a period of time may get moved around, leading to poor and unpredictable performance inside the guest.

=== Current status ===
* Initialization
* Last updated date: 11 Nov 2013

=== Detailed Description ===

*engine modifications:
**Modify the Add/Edit VM dialog, add new tab NUMA
**Add two input, one is for NUMA nodeset, another is for Virtual NUMA / topology
[[File:NUMA_and_Virtual_NUMA.png]]
*vsdm modifications:
** Add numatune/memory in domain documents
** Add cpu/numa/cell in domain documents
When this is set the VM should be marked as non-migratable

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Allows the users to get better performance from their VM's through using all CPU related memory - including the ones not handled by qemu/kvm.
Allows the users to get better performance from their VM's through split virtual NUMA node.
