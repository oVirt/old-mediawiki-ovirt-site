These pages are to organise work on the reorganisation of the [http://www.ovirt.org ovirt.org front page], the identification of missing documentation we should add, and the organoisation and maintenance of the wiki.

== Priorities ==

* Provide an automated way for someone to create an account on the wiki. We should not require that a user who wants to edit a page in the wiki contact an existing account holder personally beforehand. We can enable the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ConfirmAccount ConfirmAccount extension] to allow a more standard moderator workflow, and add a number of people to the Bureaucrat role, for example.
* Review top level menu and web pages, and propose an alternative organisation. Some things are prominent that don't need to be, other things which should be are not.
* Start spring-cleaning the wiki: make a more attractive front page, categorise pages, and generally work on making it more easily navigable
* Gap analysis on the documentation we have - what docs do we need which we don't have yet?
* Migrate PDF documentation to HTML (either static or wiki)
* Promotion of the 3.1 release
