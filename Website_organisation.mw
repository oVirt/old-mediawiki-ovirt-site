These pages are to organise work on the reorganisation of the [http://www.ovirt.org ovirt.org front page], the identification of missing documentation we should add, and the organisation and maintenance of the wiki.

== Priorities ==

* Provide an automated way for someone to create an account on the wiki. Rather than requiring a user to contact an existing account holder, we can enable the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ConfirmAccount ConfirmAccount extension] to allow a more standard moderator workflow, and add a number of people to the Bureaucrat role.
* Review top level menu and web pages, and propose an alternative organisation. Some things are prominent that don't need to be, other things which should be are not.
* Start spring-cleaning the wiki: make a more attractive front page, categorise pages, and generally work on making it more easily navigable (page renaming is crucial)
* Gap analysis on the documentation we have - what docs do we need which we don't have yet?
* Migrate PDF documentation to HTML (either static or wiki)
* Promotion of the oVirt 3.1 release

== Front page organisation ==

* There is no link to the wiki
* Activity isn't really useful - should be a subsection of Community
* Community activity and Activity are redundant
* We need a "Documentation" section, which can include guides and wiki pages (I only see the presentation resources and the wiki, so perhaps we can have everything in the wiki for now).
* "News and events" could go in "Activity"
* Create opportunities to engage - make "Community" the second most important page after "Get oVirt"
* We need a big "Get oVirt" link on the front page with a link to download + instructions.

=== Wiki spring cleaning ===
* Clean up and organise front page into two main parts: oVirt users knowledge base, and oVirt contributors workspace
** User pages will include tutorials, documentation, architecture overviews
** Developer pages will have developer getting started tutorials, workspaces for Infra and website, developer documentation for people who want to get started/build from source* Rename all pages as per [[Help:Wiki_structure#Page_naming]]
* Rename all pages as per [[Help:Wiki_structure#Page_naming]]
* Add categories to facilitate search
** Clean-up existing categories - duplicates, orphans, redundancies - and get a simple few top-level categories
* Eliminate any orphan pages, consolidate redundant pages, split long pages, version docs for the oVirt version they apply to - basic wiki gardening
* Refresh docs for oVirt 3.1

=== Gap analysis ===

* "Installing oVirt on Fedora 17" - I thought this existed, but can't find it
* "Quick start oVirt cluster" - getting oVirt up and running from scratch with an engine, a storage domain, and two nodes
* "Adding a new node to a cluster"
* Screenshots, Engine walkthrough for common tasks
* "Integrating a Gluster/Ceph storage cluster"

=== PDF documentation ===

All of the documentation on [http://www.ovirt.org/project/resources/ the resources page] is either in PDF presentation form, or ODF and PDF document format. Specifically, we should migrate the following to the wiki, and complete with screenshots/images as necessary:
* [[Architecture | oVirt architecture deep dive]] - from [http://www.redhat.com/summit/2011/presentations/summit/in_the_weeds/thursday/2011_iheim_acathrow_thur_1400_rhev_deepdive.pdf RHEV deep dive] presentation. The Architecture page needs a little more explanation.
* ovirt-node overview
* ovirt-storage overview
* vdsm overview
* ovirt-engine overview
* [[Building oVirt engine | Starting a developer environment]] - this is the equivalent of the resource "ovirt-dev-setup.pdf"
