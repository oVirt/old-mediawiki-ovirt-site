== Summary ==
Enhancing oVirt template model to allow for more flexible options in creating virtual machines targeted at improving self service for the private cloud use cases.
 
* Allow administrators to define hardware profiles (“Instance Types” or “Flavours”) 
* Allow administrators to define and publish images (similar to amazon AMIs or OpenStack images)
* Allow administrators and users, based on permissions, to create virtual machines from pre-defined images and hardware profiles.

== Current status ==
* Target Release: 3.5
* Status: under design and discussion.

== Background ==
In oVirt 3.1 the template definition includes both the hardware configuration and the image
To support more cloud use cases we wish to separate the hardware configuration of the virtual machine from the actual image type.
 
In a ''cloud'' use case the typical flow involves a user selecting the hardware configuration (for example “Small”  and the image (eg. RHEL 6.3 Web server”).
 
The current model used by oVirt forces a user to select a template that includes both the hardware configuration and the image type.
 
In many cloud platforms the following concepts and terminology are used:
 
'''Instance Type (or flavor)'''<br>
Used to describe the hardware configuration of the virtual machines.<br>
For example “medium” including 1 virtual CPU and 4GB of memory.
It will be a top-level entity (e.g. not bound to any DC/Cluster). It could be by default enabled/disabled and than this enable/disable overridden per cluster.
For example an instance type named "Huge" could be by default disabled and enabled only for a one specific cluster.
 
'''Image'''<br>
Used to describe the virtual machine disk image. (Amazon uses the term AMI)
This is the base operating system image including applications.
The image is stateless, any changes made to the image are lost after stopping the virtual machine.<br>
For example “Windows 2008R2 with SQLServer”
 
'''Volume'''<br>
Used to describe a persistent disk that is attached to a virtual machine.
Volumes are optional - a virtual machine might run in a completely stateless fashion with no attached volumes.
 
In these environments when provisioning a virtual machine a user picks an instance type/flavor and an image, combining the two to create running instance.
 
Typically the image is stateless, when the virtual machine is stopped all changes are lost.
A user can add volumes to the virtual machines, which are persistent disks typically used as a data disk.
 
'''Template'''<br>
The old template used in the oVirt until now.

'''VM'''<br>
The VM is a combination of the triple instance type, image and template (while any of this three can be empty).
For details on where the specific fields will come from please see the detailed table: http://wiki.ovirt.org/Features/Instance_Types#Design

== Design ==
The following table enumerates all the fields involved and also how they are related to the entities. 
 
The specific columns means:
* '''Present''': this field is present on the entity for user editing
* '''Comm''': comment for the entity
* '''Perms''': new permissions needed
* '''Adv Only''': the new VM dialog will contain a button "Advanced Options". If the field is marked as Adv Only: Y than it is visible only after clicking this button
* '''Basic User''': if the user is not an admin user, only the fields which are marked as Basic User: Y will be editable for him
* '''Marked''': if Y, it means the field is "special" and if the user changes it, the instance type will change to "custom"
* '''On Create''': default value when creating the VM
 
The specific values means:
* '''Y''': yes
* '''N''': no
* '''D''':  deprecated
* '''Not in GUI''': not directly editable from GUI. Either not editable at all or gets the value indirectly (e.g. from to selected OS)
* '''Values for On Create''': ''User'' = user is required to fill it, ''Instance'' = copied from instance, ''merge'' = merge of two or more entities (comment describes how), ''Image'' = copied from image, ''empty'' = empty

== Entities' Details ==
=== VM ===
The "New Server" and "New Desktop" buttons in GUI will be replaced by a common '''New VM''' button with a combo box where you can choose from "Optimized for Server" and "Optimized for Desktop". 
The exact meaning this switch:
* '''Optimized for Server''': 
** does not have soundcard
** the disk image is cloned
** is not stateless
* '''Optimized for Desktop''': 
** has soundcard
** the image is used (thin allocation)
** is stateless
This are only the default values which will be present in the GUI - the user can change them.

For more details, please consult the [http://www.ovirt.org/images/9/9e/Instance_type.pdf new/edit VM dialog mockups].

=== Image ===
Will be created from an existing VM using the '''Create Image''' - similar to the way how the templates are created today.
Opened question: Do we want them to be stateless in 3.3?
 
=== Volume ===
Opened question: Do we want this to 3.3?
 
=== Instance Types (Flavors) ===
A user should be able to create an instance type using a dialog similar to the '''New VM''' dialog. Here a user should be able to define their instance configuration.<br>
For the exact editable field please see the table above.
 
'''Predefined Instance Types'''<br><br>
A set of predefined instance types should be created. <br>
For consistency we should use the default OpenStack sizes.<br>
A user should be allowed to edit but not delete predefined instance types<br>
The administrator should be able to disable instance types.<br>

'''Extra Instance Metadata'''<br><br>
 
Within the design of the instance entity we should bear in mind that in the future we may need to incorporate elements from the SLA/QoS work. <br>
None of these are appropriate for the 3.3 release.<br>
 
For example adding quality of service parameters.<br>
As a point of reference OpenStack includes parameters such as “rxtx quota” that allows the administrator to cap the maximum amount of network I/O permitting (for example an ISP capping a customer to 5GB).<br>
Other use cases include specifying storage I/O priorty, network capping and throttling.<br>
 
=== Templates ===
The existing template mechanism can be used to handle ''Images''.
 
== Example User Workflow ==
This is an example of the user workflow, how the new Instance Types approach would be used.
 
1: Create a new '''Instance Type'''
: In the Templates main tab click the ''New Instance Type'' button, than fill and save the provided dialog
2: Create a new '''Image'''
: In the ''Virtual Machines'' main tab selct a VM, than click ''Create Image'' which will extract the image and the image specific configuration (similar to current ''make template'')
3: Create a new VM
: In ''Virtual Machines'' main tab click the "New VM" button. Select the data center, cluster, instance type, image and assigns the logical network to network interface, than click OK.
4: Run the created VM
5: Edit ''Instance Type'' (e.g. added more memory to it)
6: The change is reflected also on the VM after restarting it
 
== Runtime ==
 
When a virtual machine is run the complete configuration should already been constructed<br>
* The instance type is used to provide the hardware configuration for the VM.
** This setting should be applied at configuration not at runtime time
** If an instance type is updated (eg. added 2GB of memory) then the next time this VM is launched it should still run with the old configuration
<br>
* The operating system type and disks are taken from the Image
** If the VM is set to be stateless then the disks from the Image are set to be stateless
** Note: For stateless disks the images are applied at run time not at the time that the virtual machine was defined
** If an Image is updated then the next time a stateless VM is run from this Image then the image will be updated
 
* Extra disks that are defined at the VM level are added to the VM.
<br>
 
We should allow changing the instance type on a VM that is down<br>
* for example: changing vm from instance type 'medium' to 'large' or to 'custom' (which allow user editing all fields)<br>
* this sounds reasonable but there is a problem with some fields which are defined in instance-type,<br>
if we have defaults for server and desktops (clone disks vs. thin allocation),<br>
changing instance type will not take affect on this.

== Permissions ==
New permissions will be needed:
* '''Create Instance''': This permission will allow a user to create a new virtual machine from an existing instance type (but not edit the instance type itself)
* '''Instance Owner''': This permission will allow a user to:
** Add/Remove disks
** Add/Remove NICS
** Edit instance (VM) for a limited set of parameters (the "Basic User" from the table above)
 
== User Interface ==
* Templates:
** '''Templates''' main tab should remain as-is
** '''Templates''' main tab should be displayed only when selecting the '''Templates''' node below '''[DC-Name]''' in the left-pane-tree. 
Otherwise, it should be hidden (including for System).
 
* Instance Types:
** A new '''Instance Types''' main tab should be added
** A new '''Instance Types''' node should be added to the left-pane-tree under each '''[DC-Name]'''. 
** No items should exist under it (i.e. it is just a "link", just like the '''VMs''' tree-node). 
** When selected, only "Instance Types" main tab should be displayed, filtered according to the relevant DC.
** '''Instance Types''' main tab should be displayed only if the '''[DC-Name]''' tree-node is selected or if the '''Instance Types''' tree-node under '''[DC-Name]''' is selected. 
Otherwise, it should be hidden (including for System).
 
* Images:
** A new '''Images''' main tab should be added.
** A new '''Images''' node should be added to the left-pane tree under each "[DC-Name]". 
No items should exist under it (i.e. it is just a "link", just like the "VMs" tree-node). 
When selected, only "Images" main tab should be displayed, filtered according to the relevant DC.
 
* In the '''Disks''' main tab, there is an '''Images''' radio-button; this radio-button should be renamed, in order to avoid confusion.
* '''Images''' main tab should be displayed only if the '''[DC-Name]''' tree-node is selected or if the '''Images''' tree-node under '''[DC-Name]''' is selected. 
Otherwise, it should be hidden (including for System).
 
== REST API ==
TBD as soon as the specific requirements will be clarified

== Testing ==
The current implementation covers only the GUI changes as presented in the attached mockups.
=== Test Logical Network Editor ===

Have a cluster of version 3 and one logical network

==== Test Case 1  ====
* Press new VM button
* One network interface should be present with a combo box containing the logical network and an empty line
* Select  the logical network and create the VM
* New VM should be created with the NIC created and the logical network assigned

==== Test Case 2  ====
* Press new VM button
* One network interface should be present with a combo box containing the logical network and an empty line
* Select  the empty line and create the VM
* New VM should be created with the NIC created and no logical network assigned

==== Test Case 3  ====
Have a VM with 2 NICs. One of them has the logical network assigned and one does not
* Select that VM and press the edit button
* The NICs should be present in the dialog and the correct values selected in the corresponding virtual network combo boxes
* Select the opposite value for both NICs (e.g. no network for the one with network and the network for the one without it)
* Save
* The VM should have the NICs with correctly assigned networks

==== Test Case 4  ====
Have a VM without NICs
* Select that VM and open the edit VM dialog
* There should be no networks on the dialog listed

==== Test Case 5 ====
Have a template with 2 NICs
* Press new VM and in new VM dialog select this template
* The NICs from the template should be present in the dialog
* Assign them the network and press OK
* Verify that the NICs are the correct copy of the templates' NICs and have the correct networks assigned

=== Test Server/Desktop Unification ===
==== Test Case 1 ====
* Verify there is no new Server/ new Desktop buttons anymore - only one new VM

==== Test Case 2 ====
* Press new VM and set the VM type to Server
* The Console/Soundcard checkbox should be unchecked
* Set the VM type to Desktop
* The Console/Soundcard checkbox should be checked

==== Test Case 3 ====
* Verify that if the Console/Soundcard checkbox is checked the VM contains the soundcard device regardless the VM type

==== Test Case 4 ====
* Verify that the VM type is taken from the Template
* Verify that the VM type is editable after VM creation

=== Type Aheads ===

==== Test Case 1 ====
* Open new VM dialog
* Verify that the Data Center and cluster is unifyed under the name of Cluster
* Click into the Cluster text box 
* The text type ahead suggestions should contain the following text: <Cluster Name> | <Data Center Description - if the DC has no Description than DC name>
* Click into the Template text box
* The type ahead suggestions should contain the following text: <Template Name | <Template description or nothing if there is no description for the template>

==== Test Case 2 ====
* Verify you can select the the value from each type ahead using keyboard, mouse or using typing 
* Verify that if you add incorrect value to the type ahead than it returns to the previous one
* Verify that if you enter no value it returns to the previous one
* Verify that type ahead works also with different locales
