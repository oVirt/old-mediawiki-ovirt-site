=== Detailed Description ===

==== Webadmin/Power User Portal ====

===== Disk-less template =====
* There will be two possibilities how to create a disk-less template:
** When creating a Template from a VM, a checkbox will be present on the "New Template" dialog with text "Make template disk-less"
** On Templates tab a button "New" will be added. It will open the same dialog as the "Edit" button does, and will be used to create a new disk-less template
* The Template -> Disks subtab will be used to attach the disks of the template the same way as the VMs' disks are attached

===== Running a template =====
* There will be a possibility to run the template in two modes:
** Stateless: any changes made during this run on the disk will be forgotten after the VM is stopped (used for verifying that the template is correct)
** Stateful: any changes made during this run on the disk will be written to the disk after the VM is stopped (used to e.g. upgrade a program in it etc)

Under the hood, the run template will create a VM and run it. By default, this VM will not be visible in the "Virtual Machines" tab, however, there 
will be a way (radio button like for the Disks maintab) which will enable or disable to show the "internal" VMs.

==== REST API ====
TBD as soon as the specific requirements will be clarified
