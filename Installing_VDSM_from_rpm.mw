== Configuring the bridge Interface ==
Disable the network manager service by executing as root:
 <nowiki>
systemctl stop NetworkManager.service
systemctl disable NetworkManager.service

service network start
chkconfig network on
 </nowiki>

Add the following content into a new file named: '''/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-engine''':
 <nowiki>
DEVICE=engine
TYPE=Bridge
ONBOOT=yes
DELAY=0
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
ONBOOT=yes
 </nowiki>

Add the following line into the configuration file of your out going interface (usually em1/eth0)
the file is located at: '''/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-em1''' (assuming the device is em1)
 <nowiki>
BRIDGE=engine

== Installing & Configuring VDSM ==
=== Install ===
Install VDSM by executing as root the following commands:
 <nowiki>
yum install -y vdsm vdsm-cli
 </nowiki>

=== Configure ===
Add the following content into the file: '''/etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf''' (you may need to create that file):
 <nowiki>
[vars]
ssl = false
 </nowiki>

Restart the vdsmd service by executing:
 <nowiki>
service vdsmd restart

If Vdsm was started earlier with ssl=true, it would refuse to start and you may need to use the undocumented verb
 <nowiki>
service vdsmd reconfigure
service vdsmd start
 </nowiki>
which edits '''/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf''' and changes '''spice_tls=1''' to '''spice_tls=0'''.
