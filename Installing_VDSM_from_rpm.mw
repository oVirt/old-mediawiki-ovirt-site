This Documents has come to describe the steps required in order to install &
configure VDSM on the same host with ovirt-engine, this steps are usually
not required when installing VDSM on another host than ovirt-engine<BR>
Use this guide in order to install ovirt-engine: [[Installing_ovirt-engine_from_rpm]]

== Installing Prerequisite Packages ==
execute the following command as root:
 <nowiki>
yum install -y bridge-utils</nowiki>

== Configuring oVirt's Repository ==
Execute the following command:
 <nowiki>
sudo yum install http://ovirt.org/releases/ovirt-release-fedora.noarch.rpm
</nowiki>

= VDSM =
== Configuring the bridge Interface ==
Disable the network manager service by executing as root:
 <nowiki>
systemctl stop NetworkManager.service
systemctl disable NetworkManager.service

service network start
chkconfig network on</nowiki>

Add the following content into a new file named: '''/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ovirtmgmt''':
 <nowiki>
DEVICE=ovirtmgmt
TYPE=Bridge
ONBOOT=yes
DELAY=0
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=192.168.1.110
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1</nowiki>

Add the following line into the configuration file of your out going interface (usually em1/eth0)
the file is located at: '''/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-em1''' (assuming the device is em1)
 <nowiki>
BRIDGE=ovirtmgmt</nowiki>
and remove the IPADDR, NETMASK and BOOTPROTO keys, since the interface should not have an IP address of its own.
Full Example
 <nowiki>
DEVICE=em1
ONBOOT=yes
BRIDGE=ovirtmgmt</nowiki>

Restart the network service by executing:
 <nowiki>
service network restart</nowiki>

'''Note that if any other bridge (from ovirtmgmt) is present at the time of host installation, the bridge creation operation is skipped and you have to change the bridge settings to correspond to above shown configuration manually.'''

== Installing & Configuring VDSM ==
=== Install ===
Install VDSM by executing as root the following commands:
 <nowiki>
yum install -y vdsm vdsm-cli</nowiki>
Note:if you are using vdsm-4.10.0, you may need to install libvirt-0.10.0 which can't be found in yum.
You can find the libvirt rpm in the following page:http://libvirt.org/sources/

=== Configure ===
Add the following content into the file: '''/etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf''' (you may need to create that file):
 <nowiki>
[vars]
ssl = false</nowiki>

Restart the vdsmd service by executing:
 <nowiki>
systemctl restart vdsmd</nowiki>

If Vdsm was started earlier with ssl=true, it would refuse to start and you may need to use the undocumented verb
 <nowiki>
vdsm-tool configure --force
systemctl start vdsmd</nowiki>
which edits '''/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf''' and changes '''spice_tls=1''' to '''spice_tls=0'''.
