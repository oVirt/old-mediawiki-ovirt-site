If you are upgrading from a previous version, you may have the ovirt-release34 package already installed on your system.
You can then install ovirt-release35.rpm as in a clean install side-by-side.

Once ovirt-release35 package is installed,  you will have the ovirt-3.5-stable repository and any other repository needed for satisfying dependencies enabled by default.

If you're installing oVirt 3.5.3 on a clean host, you should read our [[Quick Start Guide]].

Please see [[oVirt 3.4.1 release notes]] for upgrade instructions.

For upgrading now you just need to execute:
 # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
 # engine-setup

= What's New in 3.5.3? =

=Known issues=

== PKI ==

Due to certificate incompatibility issue with rfc2459[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1210486] and potential of certificate expiration [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1214860] since first release, the CA, Engine, Apache and Websocket proxy certificates may be renewed during upgrade.

The renew process should introduce no downtime for the engine and hosts communications, however users' browsers may require acceptance of the new CA certificate. The new CA certificate which is located at /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem should be distributed to all remote components that require PKI trust.

== Upgrade issues ==
* Engine and host upgrade ordering due to bug {{BZ|1196327}}. When upgrading your deployment to 3.5.2 please your upgrade engine first and next your hosts. When following order is not preserved you will see following error every 3 seconds (by default):

 ERROR [org.ovirt.engine.core.vdsbroker.vdsbroker.ListVDSCommand] (DefaultQuartzScheduler_Worker-28) [] Command 'ListVDSCommand(HostName = kenji, HostId = 9f569269-d267-4bf9-96c5-e1749b4c8dda, vds=Host[kenji,9f569269-d267-4bf9-96c5-e1749b4c8dda])' execution failed: java.util.LinkedHashMap cannot be cast to java.lang.String

Following exception prevents host monitoring but affected host stays in status 'UP' and is operational. Virtual machine status collection is gathered every 15 seconds (by default).

== Distribution specific issues ==
* NFS startup on EL7 / Fedora20: due to other bugs ({{BZ|1144440}}  or {{BZ|1066959}} ), NFS service is not always able to start at first attempt (it doesn't wait the kernel module to be ready); if it happens oVirt engine setup detects it and aborts with
 [ INFO  ] Restarting nfs services
 [ ERROR ] Failed to execute stage 'Closing up': Command '/bin/systemctl' failed to execute
Retrying (engine-cleanup, engine-setup again) it's enough to avoid it cause the kernel module it's always ready on further attempts. Manually starting NFS service (/bin/systemctl restart nfs-server.service) before running engine setup it's enough to avoid it at all.

* NFS startup on EL7.1 requires manual startup of rpcbind.service {{BZ|1171603}} before running engine setup in order to avoid
 [ INFO  ] Restarting nfs services
 [ ERROR ] Failed to execute stage 'Closing up': Command '/bin/systemctl' failed to execute
