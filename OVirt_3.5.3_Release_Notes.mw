=Known issues=

== PKI ==

Due to certificate incompatibility issue with rfc2459[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1210486] and potential of certificate expiration [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1214860] since first release, the CA, Engine, Apache and Websocket proxy certificates may be renewed during upgrade.

The renew process should introduce no downtime for the engine and hosts communications, however users' browsers may require acceptance of the new CA certificate. The new CA certificate which is located at /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem should be distributed to all remote components that require PKI trust.
