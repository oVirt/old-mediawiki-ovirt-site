=== Detailed Description ===
Currently we are persisting the Timezone and Domain for Sysprep Windows based machines and Cloud-init data via Run-Once dialog.
We want to be able to add more granularity to Sysprep such as saving a Windows serial key and persisting the current Cloud-init data that we have via the Run-Once dialog.
The VM-Init section will have its own tab in Add/Edit VM and will stay the same for the Run-Once dialog
