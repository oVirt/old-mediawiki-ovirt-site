=== Detailed Description ===
'''Unbalanced cluster'''

[[File:balancing-before.png||Unbalanced cluster]]

'''Cluster after 1 balancing iteration'''

[[File:balancing-after1iter.png]]

'''Cluster after 2 balancing iterations'''

[[File:balancing-after2iter.png]]

==== 2. iteration: ====
# VM2 moved to VDS5 (the only possible target, because it's the only one outside of the balancing window)
# The balancing window top moved from 11 to 10 and the minimum is now 6 which means the cluster is balanced because every VDS has VM count inside the balancing window



=== Benefit to oVirt ===
This feature comes from customer request, so benefit to ovirt is a better customer satisfaction ;)

pseudo code for the balance() method

<pre>
getOverloadedVDS():
  worstVDS = None
  for vds in allVDS:
    if vds.activeVMSCount() > MAX_VMS_COUNT AND (worstVDS == None OR vds.activeVMSCount() > worstVDS.activeVMSCount()):
      worstVDS = vds

  return  worstVDS  # returns None (null) if no VDS has above MAX_VMS_COUNT running vms
</pre>

<pre>
balance():
  worstVDS = getOverloadedVDS()
  if worstVDS == None:  # nothing to balance
     return None

  possibleTargets = [ vds for vds in allVDS if worstVDS() - vds.activeVMCount() > BALANCE_WINDOW_WIDTH ]
 
  return (possibleTargets, vmToMigrate)
</pre>

=== Testing ===
- TBD
