== Summary ==
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
The use of Docker containers make easier to locally deploy Cinder and Glance on the engine host.
We are going to use docker images from kollaglue project: kollaglue is the official effort to deploy openstack components via docker.

== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
The aim of this feature is to let the user simply deploy and configure cinder and glance within the engine from engine-setup.

To avoid any new strong dependency a new engine-setup plugin will be developed.
Installing that plugin from its rm and running engine-setup the user will be able to pull the right docker containers, configure them and configure them as external providers within the engine.

== Benefit to oVirt ==
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
The user will be able to locally run glance to import and store VM images and cinder to access external volumes.
Deploying them as docker images makes it more easier to be accomplished without the need for a manual complex configuration.

== Dependencies / Related Features ==
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->

glance could be already used as an external provider from the engine,
cinder integraton still require more effort on backend side: http://www.ovirt.org/Features/Cinder_Integration

== Documentation / External references ==
<!-- Is there upstream documentation on this feature, or notes you have written yourself?  Link to that material here so other interested developers can get involved. Links to RFEs. -->

glance requires two distinct containers:
 kollaglue/centos-rdo-glance-registry:latest
 kollaglue/centos-rdo-glance-api:latest
cinder one:
 kollaglue/centos-rdo-cinder:latest

both of them requires additional containers:
 kollaglue/centos-rdo-rabbitmq:latest
 kollaglue/centos-rdo-mariadb-data:latest
 kollaglue/centos-rdo-mariadb-app:latest
 kollaglue/centos-rdo-keystone:latest

== Testing ==

Install the plugin rpm
 yum install ovirt-engine-setup-plugin-dockerc
Run engine setup
 engine-setup
Choose to deploy cinder and glance
          Deploy Cinder container on this host (Yes, No) [No]: yes
          Deploy Glance container on this host (Yes, No) [No]: yes
It should deploy and start all the required containers
