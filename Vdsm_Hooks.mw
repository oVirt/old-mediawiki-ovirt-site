== VDSM Hooks ==

=== Writing a new hook ===
This patch may be used as reference: http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/12833/

When creating a new vdsm hook, create a directory for it and place it under vdsm_hooks.
Each hook should contain at minimum three files: 
# Makefile.am 
# README 
# And the event at which the hook is fired. For example: before_vm_start. Here is where you write the actual code.

Additionally, the following changes have to be made:
# vdsm_hooks/Makefile.am - Add your hook name to the section at line 25.
# configure.ac - Add your new hook name under the section beginning at line 196.
# vdsm.spec.in - Your new hook must be placed in two different spots:
Hooks placed below line 993 are non-required hooks, while hooks immediately above
that line are installed as part of the installation even if hooks are not explicitly enabled.
Finally, you must add a package summary and description under the section at line 291.

During installation, hooks are placed at /usr/libexec/vdsm/hooks/hook_event/your_hook_name<br />
where hook_event is one of before_vm_start, before_migrate_source and so on.
