== Bridge-less Networks ==

=== Feature summary ===
 
All VMs today are connected through a software bridge, which naturally has a performance hit.<br>
Bridge-less NICs can serve for heavy traffic channels like migration, storage or the engine's management network.

=== Code Changes ===
==== Model ====
# Add bridged : String to network, VdsNetworkInterface entity
# Add deserialization to bridged field in VdsBrokerObjectsBuilder.java
# DB - add field in to vds_interface,vds_interface_view, network,network_view
# DAO - add field to VdsInterfaceDao,networkDao CRUD actions
# DAO - update tests

==== BL ====
#extend non-operational API to accept more reasons 
#remove redundant checking in monitoring code - same check for missing
#add tests for the API refactoring network in CollectVdsNetworkData and VdsManager
#refactor VdsManager to send the host to non-oper on bridge property difference with Cluster
# add tests to VdsManager for the new behaviour

=== Backward Compatibility ===
 
Its compatibility version is 3.1 and enforced by the enclosed command as mentioned already.
Bridge-less network will be edited via the SetupNetworks command only, which will eventually deprecate add/edit networks commands.
