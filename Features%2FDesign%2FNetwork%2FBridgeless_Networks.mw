== Bridge-less Networks ==

=== Summary ===
All VMs today are connected through a software bridge, which naturally has a performance hit.<br>
Bridge-less NICs can serve for heavy traffic channels like migration, storage or the engine's management network.

Also looking forward a capable of running VMs nics should be bridged on 
regular nics and un-bridged in case of dedicated special nics

=== Code Changes ===
==== Model ====
# Add bridged : boolean  VdsNetworkInterface entity
# Add allowToRunVms : boolean  network entity

# Add deserialization to bridged field in VdsBrokerObjectsBuilder.java
# DB - add field in to vds_interface,vds_interface_view, network,network_view
# DAO - add field to VdsInterfaceDao,networkDao CRUD actions
# DAO - update tests


==== BL ====
#extend non-operational API to accept more reasons 
#remove redundant checking in monitoring code - same check for missing
#add tests for the API refactoring network in CollectVdsNetworkData and VdsManager
#refactor VdsManager to send the host to non-oper on bridge property difference with Cluster "allowToRunVms" property [1]
# add tests to VdsManager for the new behaviour


==== UI ====

#UI shall append the "allow to run VMs []" checkbox to the add/edit logical network 
#UI shall user shall be able to attach the network as bridged/non-bridged network when "allowToRunVms" is false, in setup-networks UI [2]

=== Backward Compatibility ===
 
Its compatibility version is 3.1 and enforced by the enclosed command as mentioned already.
Bridge-less network will be edited via the SetupNetworks command only, which will eventually deprecate add/edit networks commands.


=== open issues ===
[1] if a network is checked with "allowToRunVms" and an underlying host will need an un-bridged(SRIOV...) network to fulfil that <BR>
how do we treat that during monitoring? we should be able to distinguish on interfaces that can run vm with/without bridge <BR>
and deduce that cluster compatibility didn't break
[2] if, for some reason an admin wants a non VM network to be bridged, should we allow it?
