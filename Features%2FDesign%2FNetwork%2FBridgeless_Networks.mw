=== Functionality ===
An admin can now set a logical network as "VM network" so when attaching a Network to an Host's NIC, <br>
a "Vm network" is implemented over a bridge, otherwise bridgeless<br>

=== create logical network ===

*create network under the DC - check the "VM network" box.
*GUI may have the VM network box checked by default
*to edit this property a network should be detached from all clusters

=== Modified flows ===

==== Add a Nic to VM ====
* validate the Nic's network is vmNetwork - fail with canDoAction ACTION_TYPE_FAILED_NOT_A_VM_NETWORK

==== Import VM ====
* validate all Nic's networks are vmNetwork - fire audit log IMPORT_VM_INTERFACES_ON_NON_VM_NETWORKS
* don't fail the import

==== Run VM ====
* validate all Nic's networks is vmNetwork - fail with canDoAction ACTION_TYPE_FAILED_NOT_A_VM_NETWORK

==== setupNetworks ====
* implicitly set VdsNetworkInterface as bridged when vmNetwork = true

==== Monitoring ====
*refresh caps (when host is activated)- detect if there are VM networks that are implemented as bridgeless - if yes set host non-operational with reason VM_NETWORK_IS_BRIDGELESS
*afterRefreshTreatment (runtime info) - same as above

=== Modelling ===
