== Introduction ==
VDSM is a daemon component written in Python required by oVirt-Engine (Virtualization Manager), which runs on Linux hosts and manages and monitors the host's storage, memory and networks as well as virtual machine creation/control, statistics gathering, etc.
'''VDSM Fake''' is a support application framework for oVirt Engine project. It is a Java web application which enables to simulate selected tasks of real VDSM. But, tens or hundreds of simulated Linux hosts and virtual machines can be reached with very limited set of hardware resources.
The aim is to get marginal performance characteristics of oVirt Engine JEE application (JBoss) and its repository database (PostgreSQL), but also network throughput, etc.

== Technology ==
The basic idea is that fake host addresses must resolve to a single IP address (127.0.0.1 is also possible for all-in-one performance testing server configuration). Standard HTTP port 54321 must be accessible from the Engine. You can use /etc/hosts file on the server with oVirt-Engine or company DNS server.
Apache XML-RPC library is a core technology for the Engine vs. VDSM communication.
Many configured entities must be persisted after their creation. Simple Java object serialization is used for this purpose (directory /var/log/vdsmfake/cache).

== Functionality ==
The application runs in 2 modes:
* simulation
* proxy to real VDSM

All or selected XML requests/responses are optionally logged into a directory (/var/log/vdsmfake/xml).
Currently the configuration is possible changable in web.xml, log4j.xml files only.

== Supported methods ==
* create hosts
* create/attach/activate DATA/EXPORT/ISO NFS storage domains
* create VM from iso (+ create network, create volume)
* run/shutdown VM
* migrate VM
