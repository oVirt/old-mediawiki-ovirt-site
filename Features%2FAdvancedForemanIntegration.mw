=== Summary ===
[http://theforeman.org/ Foreman] [1] The Foreman is a complete lifecycle management tool for physical and virtual servers.
Through deep integration with configuration management, DHCP, DNS, TFTP, and PXE-based unattended installations, Foreman manages every stage of the lifecycle of your physical or virtual servers. The Foreman provides comprehensive, auditable interaction facilities including a web frontend and robust, RESTful API. 
[https://launchpad.net/cloud-init/ Cloud-init] [1] is a tool used to perform initial setup on cloud nodes, including networking, SSH keys, timezone, user data injection, and more.  It is a service that runs on the guest, and supports various Linux distributions including Fedora, RHEL, and Ubuntu.

Integrating Foreman with oVirt will help adding hypervisor hosts that are managed by Foreman to the oVirt engine (installed hosts, discovered hosts, etc.) VM configuration and etc.

Today, there is basic Foreman integration, described in [2], which allows the administrator to see hosts installed in Foreman, and get their basic details.
This feature aims to extend this integration to cover other aspects such as Bare-Metal provisioning, VM provisioning and Host configuration.

=== Current Status ===
* Approving final design concepts and last curve of implementation phase for tech preview
* Using Foreman 1.6-develop version

=== Detailed Description ===

==== Use Cases ====
* The following use-cases assume you already have a Foreman provider in the system. For more information on adding Foreman providers have a look at [2].
* Foreman setup must include the following plugins (for plugin installation guide follow [3]):
 * https://github.com/theforeman/ovirt_provision_plugin (>=0.0.1)- Allows full integration with oVirt after provisioning new host
 * https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_discovery (>=1.3.0.rc2)- Foreman pack for bare metal discovery feature

For yum installation perform:
 * yum -y install http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.5/el6/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm
 * Enable foreman-nightly and foreman-plugins-nightly repositories
 * yum -y install ruby193-rubygem-ovirt_provision_plugin ruby193-rubygem-foreman_discovery

 [TODO: remove this section when plugin gets to official repo] Currently you can use:
 http://yum.theforeman.org/plugins/nightly/el6/x86_64/ruby193-rubygem-ovirt_provision_plugin-0.0.1-1.el6.noarch.rpm
 The plugin requires also rbovirt updates, which can be found in: http://yum.theforeman.org/nightly/el6/x86_64/ruby193-rubygem-rbovirt-0.0.28-1.el6.noarch.rpm
 
===== First phase - Bare-Metal provisioning =====

Prerequisites:
* Foreman admin has a designated host group(s) in foreman for that purpose to define full provision setup with default values
* Have the proper images for the OS installation setup in the foreman setup
* Correlate the defined Host group with relevant templates  (PXE / kickstart files) associated to the relevant OSs
- For oVirt Node provisioning also provide appropriate cmdline arguments inside the PXE provision template, such as:
 append initrd=<%= @initrd %> ks=<%= foreman_url('provision')%> root=live:/[filename].iso BOOTIF=link storage_init rhevm_admin_password=123 adminpw=123 management_server=[ip]:[port] rootfstype=auto ro liveimg check RD_NO_LVM rd_NO_MULTIPATH rootflags=ro crashkernel=128M elevator=deadline quiet max_loop=256 rhgb rd_NO_LUKS rd_NO_MD rd_NO_DM ONERROR LOCALBOOT 0 
* oVirt needs proper permissions to view relevant bare-metal hosts, host groups, compute resources and execute provision request.
* Set Foreman's compute resource that correlates to the required permissions (Availability to approve and add host by custom plugin. For more information about Foreman plugin see [3])
* Define puppet class for installing oVirt-Engine public key to allow deploy oVirt on provisioned host
- For example:
 class ovirt-pk {                                                                
        # create a directory                                                    
        file { "/root/.ssh":                                                    
                ensure => "directory",                                          
                before => File['/root/.ssh/authorized_keys'],                   
        }                                                                       
        file { "/root/.ssh/authorized_keys":                                    
                path => '/root/.ssh/authorized_keys',                           
                ensure => file,                                                 
                source => "puppet:///modules/ovirt-pk/authorized_keys",         
        }                                                                       
 }

# Add new host form in oVirt shows new list of discovered hosts taken from Foreman
# Select a host group for this host. all proper configuration needs to be declared in host group definition (part of Foreman setup)
# Select compute resource to allow access back from Foreman to oVirt (part of Foreman setup)
# All "discovered" information will filled out in the new host form, edit them as desired

[[File:Discover-5-phase.png]]
the following system flow will occur:
# add the host to foreman using the API (Provision the discovered host)
# The host will be added and appear in the oVirt UI with status "Installing OS" util the following ends:
## For oVirt-node hosts - the registration will occur through the oVirt-node (assuming the kernel parameters are configured for that Foreman template), and the host will be approved automatically by Foreman
## For other OS - at first step won't do the registration by themselves, but foreman will do that using a plugin (plugin will send REST-API call to add or approve  the host)

Open issues:

===== Second phase -  VM provisioning - add new VMs which will be configured by Foreman =====

We have two options here:
a. Add the VM through oVirt, and then add it to Foreman as bare-metal (add the oVirt compute resource) - only PXE installation, passing the MAC address to foreman
b. Add the VM through foreman (using compute resource)

I'd go with option "a", as it leaves the VM creation similar to what we have today. However, we don't really leverage oVirt templates with that approach.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
* Better integration with external host providers, that will ease the work for the administrator
* Providing an interface that other host providers can implement, to add their own properties and logic

=== Setup Testing Environment ===
To allow testing the feature in "allinone" configuration, which means running foreman on a Vm and simulate new bare-metal hosts with new Vms, you should configure the following on your hypervisor:
(NOTE: This manual set the foreman subnet to 192.168.223.0, which 192.168.223.2 is the foreman Vm address and 192.168.223.1 is the gateway to the external network)
* Enable IP forwarding
 Edit /etc/sysctl.conf and set "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1"
* Create virt network
 save the following to file called foreman_net.xml:
  <network>
   <name>foreman</name>
    <uuid>3a80901c-a020-4e7a-bd3b-770b29844b03</uuid>
    <forward mode='nat'>
    <nat>
     <port start='1024' end='65535'/>
    </nat>
    </forward>
    <bridge name='virbrforeman' stp='off' delay='0'/>
     <mac address='52:54:00:38:f9:08'/>
     <ip address='192.168.223.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'></ip>
  </network>
* Set the network to virsh
 # virsh - vdsm@ovirt:shibboleth
 # net-define /path/to/foreman_net.xml
 # net-autostart foreman
 # net-start foreman 
 With "ip -4 a" you should see that virbrforeman has the right ip
* Config engine
 #engine-config -s CustomDeviceProperties='{type=interface;prop={extnet=^[a-zA-Z0-9_ ---]+$}}'
 #engine-config -g CustomDeviceProperties
 ( You can read about it under vdsm_hooks/*extnet*/README )
* Install the vdsm-hook-extnet rpm on host
* Add the host to engine if its not already there
* Create route rule on host
  ip route add 192.168.223.0/24 scope link dev virbrforeman table 170066347
 (The number of table depends on your dhcp assigned address. You can check for yours by:  "ip rule show")
* Configure oVirt
 Go to the Networks tab
 click on "ovirtmgmt"
 then on the "vNIC Profiles" subtab
 New -> name: foreman_libvirt_net ->  in "please select a key" select extnet and put "foreman" as value
* Set foreman Vm network by running
 ip addr add dev eth0 192.168.223.2/24
 ip link set dev eth0 up
 ip route add dev eth0 default via 192.168.223.1
