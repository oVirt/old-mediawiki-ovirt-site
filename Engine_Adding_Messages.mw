== Introduction ==
This page contains instructions how to add new messages to oVirt engine,
This document contains information how to handle both ''Backend'' and ''Frontend'' modules with regards to messages in order to keep them synchronized.

== Backend==
* Any message that shell be exposed by backend internal API (RunQuery / RunAction) must be delcared as a key/value pair in ''OVIRT_ENGINE/backend/manager/modules/dal/src/main/resources/bundles/AppErrors.properties''.
* For VDSM errors, every message must be declared as a key/value pair in ''OVIRT_ENGINE/backend/manager/modules/dal/src/main/resources/bundles/VdsmErrors.properties''.


== Frontend ==

For every key/value pair that was added to Backend's ''AppErrors'' and ''VdsmErrors'', the following changes must be done for the ''WebAdmin'' and ''UserPortal'' projects:

=== AppErrors.properties ===
* Another entry must be added to:
** ''frontend/webadmin/modules/webadmin/src/main/resources/org/ovirt/engine/ui/frontend/AppErrors.properties''
** ''frontend/webadmin/modules/userportal/src/main/resources/org/ovirt/engine/ui/frontend/AppErrors.properties''

Key must be equal to the key that was added to backend file, the message may be different.

=== VdsmErrors.properties ===
* Another entry must be added to:
** ''frontend/webadmin/modules/webadmin/src/main/resources/org/ovirt/engine/ui/frontend/VdsmErrors.properties''
** ''frontend/webadmin/modules/userportal/src/main/resources/org/ovirt/engine/ui/frontend/VdsmErrors.properties''

Key must be equal to the key that was added to backend file, the message may be different.


=== UI Resource ===
While backend manages its resource files as properties files only, the UI module requires the key to be added as a java interface as well:

* An interface signature must be added to ''frontend/webadmin/modules/webadmin/src/main/resources/org/ovirt/engine/ui/frontend/AppErrors.java'' (or VdsmErrors.java), the method signature must be equal to the message key with '();' postfix and 
return a string, here's an example:

For message key 

 <nowiki>
VM_NAME_CANNOT_BE_EMPTY</nowiki>

the method signature in '''AppErrors.java''' will be

 <nowiki>
String VM_NAME_CANNOT_BE_EMPTY();</nowiki>


== Notes ==
Please consider the following notes:

* For UI modules, a different message description can be specified per project.
* Keys must be UPPERCASE (Only [A-Z][0-9] should be used!), words must be separated by underscore (i.e VM_CANNOT_RUN_STATELESS_HA).
* Especially Dot(".") and space(" ") characters are not forbidden.
* For messages that are splitted across multiple lines, each line must be added by \n\.
