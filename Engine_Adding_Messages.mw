== Introduction ==
This page contains instructions how to add new messages to oVirt engine.

This document contains information how to handle both ''Backend'' and ''Frontend'' modules with regards to messages in order to keep them synchronized.

In order to add/edit a message in oVirt, please follow '''all''' instructions below in both ''Backend'' and ''Frontend'' sections.

= Audit Log Messages =
* For any Audit Log message:
** A corresponding key should be added to AuditLogType enum.
** A corresponding key should be added to VdcActionType enum.
** Need to add a severity for the message in AuditLogDirector.
** Add the message to ''OVIRT_ENGINE/backend/manager/modules/dal/src/main/resources/bundles/AuditLogMessages.properties''.

= Other messages =
== Backend==
* Any message that shall be exposed by the backend internal API (RunQuery / RunAction) must be delcared as a key/value pair in ''OVIRT_ENGINE/backend/manager/modules/dal/src/main/resources/bundles/AppErrors.properties''.
 * A corresponding key should be added to VdcBllMessages enum
* For VDSM errors, every message must be declared as a key/value pair in ''OVIRT_ENGINE/backend/manager/modules/dal/src/main/resources/bundles/VdsmErrors.properties''.
 * A corresponding key should be added to VdcBllErrors enum

== Frontend ==
For every key/value pair that was added to Backend's ''AppErrors'' and ''VdsmErrors'', the following changes '''must''' be done for the ''WebAdmin'' and ''UserPortal'' projects:

=== AppErrors.properties ===
* Another entry must be added to:
** ''frontend/webadmin/modules/webadmin/src/main/resources/org/ovirt/engine/ui/frontend/AppErrors.properties''
** ''frontend/webadmin/modules/userportal/src/main/resources/org/ovirt/engine/ui/frontend/AppErrors.properties''
** ''frontend/webadmin/modules/userportal-gwtp/src/main/resources/org/ovirt/engine/ui/frontend/AppErrors.properties''

The key must be the same as the key that was added to backend file, the message may be different.

=== VdsmErrors.properties ===
* Another entry must be added to:
** ''frontend/webadmin/modules/webadmin/src/main/resources/org/ovirt/engine/ui/frontend/VdsmErrors.properties''
** ''frontend/webadmin/modules/userportal/src/main/resources/org/ovirt/engine/ui/frontend/VdsmErrors.properties''
** ''frontend/webadmin/modules/userportal-gwtp/src/main/resources/org/ovirt/engine/ui/frontend/VdsmErrors.properties''

The key must be the same as the key that was added to backend file, the message may be different.

=== UI Resource ===
While backend manages it's resource files as properties files only, the UI module requires that the key will also be added to a java interface as well:

* An interface signature must be added to ''frontend/webadmin/modules/frontend/src/main/java/org/ovirt/engine/ui/frontend/AppErrors.java'' (or VdsmErrors.java), the method signature must consist of the message key with '();' suffix a return type of type String, here's an example:

For a message key:

 <nowiki>
VM_NAME_CANNOT_BE_EMPTY</nowiki>

the method signature in '''AppErrors.java''' will be:

 <nowiki>
String VM_NAME_CANNOT_BE_EMPTY();</nowiki>

== Notes ==
Please consider the following notes:

* For UI modules, a different message description can be specified per project.
* Keys must be UPPERCASE (Only [A-Z][0-9] should be used!), words must be separated by underscore (i.e VM_CANNOT_RUN_STATELESS_HA).
* Particularly a dot(".") and space(" ") characters are forbidden.
* For messages that are split across multiple lines, a line break can be added by using \n\.
* It is recommended to build the entire project after adding new messages to make sure the UI modules pass compilation (this is done by adding ''gwt-user'' & ''gwt-admin'' Maven profiles to the build command)
