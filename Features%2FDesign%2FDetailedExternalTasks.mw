Enable plug-in to inject tasks (Jobs) to the engine application using the REST API, change their statuses and track them from the UI. A task (Job) may have other nesting sub-tasks (Steps) under it. 
A Job is actually a container of nexted steps. each Step may have sub-steps under it. 
A steps represents one of the following:<br>
   An external command that is invoked and monitored by the plug-in
   A supported internal command that is invoked by the plug-in and monitored internally by the oVirt engine.

Each Job may have unlimited list of external/internal steps.

The following should be supported:
   Adding a job
   Adding a  step to a job or to a step (as sub-step)
   Ending a step 
   Eding a job
   Displaying all Jobs
   Displaying a specific Job
   Displaying all Steps under a specific Job
   Dislaying a specific Step under a Job

Job can be in one of the following statuses:
    STARTED   - Job was started
    FINISHED  - Job has been finished successfully
    FAILED       - Job had failed
