== Summary ==
The current host networking api (up to ovirt-engine-3.6) requires a network to be configured on top of a network interface.<br>
In order to configure a local network on the host the user had to create a dummy interface to which the network was attached.<br>
The Isolated Networks feature aimed to configure a local host on the network which isn't connected to any network interface and allows vms which are connected to it to communicate with each other.<br>
Isolated Networks will be limited to VM networks only and only MTU should be relevant in that network definition for the created isolated network.

== Benefit to oVirt ==
Local networks are desired for enabling a secured connectivity among vms, isolated from any other networks.

=== Detailed Description ===
Based on [[Features/HostNetworkingApi|Host Networking API design]], removing the constraint of having a network interface configured for each network attachment will allow the user to create a network attachment which isn't bounded to any network interface. <br>
Isolated networks will be represented on host level to reflect not being tied to any network interface:<br>
* When network attachment entity on host level is associated with an interface - it will be referred to as network configured on a nic.
* When network attachment entity on host level is ''not'' associated with any interface - it will be refereed to as an isolated network.

=== REST ===
==== Network attachment statistics sub-collection ====
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networkattachments/{networkattachment:id}/statistics
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a specific statistics for a network (if reported) which is attached to the host

==== Host Network Label resource ====
A collection designed to specify network labels on host level which aren't bounded to a specific nic.<br>
Using this resource, an isolated networks could be configured on host, if a network is labelled with the same label.
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networklabels/
* '''GET''' - list host network labels
* '''POST''' - add a label to the host

  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networklabels/{networklabel:id}
* '''GET''' - returns a specific host network label
* '''DELETE''' - removes a specific host network label

'''pros''': Using host level network labels we can support auto-provision of isolated networks<br>
'''cons''': The management of labels becomes more complex, cannot use same label for nics<br>

  /api/hosts/{host:id}/setupnetworks
No changes required. Without specifying the host_nic for the network_attachment element, an isolated will be configured on the host.
