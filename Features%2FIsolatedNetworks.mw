== Summary ==
The current host networking api (up to ovirt-engine-3.6) requires a network to be configured on top of a network interface.<br>
In order to configure a local network on the host the user had to create a dummy interface to which the network was attached.<br>
The Nicless Network feature aimed to configure a local host on the network which isn't connected to any network interface and allows vms which are connected to it to communicate with each other.<br>
Nicless Networks will be limited to VM networks only and only MTU should be relevant in that network definition for the created nicless network.

== Benefit to oVirt ==
Local networks are desired for enabling a secured connectivity among vms in an isolated matter.

=== Detailed Description ===
Based on [[Features/HostNetworkingApi|Host Networking API design]], removing the constraint of having a network interface configured for each network connection will allow the user to create a network connection which isn't bounded to any network interface. <br>
Nicless networks will be represented on host level to reflect not being tied to any network interface:<br>
* When network connection entity on host level is associated with an interface - it will be referred to as nic network.
* When network connection entity on host level is ''not'' associated with any interface - it will be refereed to as a nicless network.

=== REST ===
==== Host Network connections sub-collection ====
Introducing new sub-collections to reflect the host network configuration:

* A collection of network connections which represent how the network is provisioned on the host
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networkconnections
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a list of networks configured on the host
**# '''POST''' provision a network on the host

Where the networkconnection element will omit the host_nic element from the request.<br>

==== Host Network connection resource ====
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networkconnections/{networkconnection:id}
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a specific network configured on the host
**# '''PUT''' update a network configured on the host
**# '''DELETE''' removes a network from the host

==== Network connection statistics sub-collection ====
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networkconnections/{networkconnection:id}/statistics
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a specific statistics for a network (if reported) which is attached to the host

==== Host Network Label resource ====
A collection designed to specify network labels on host level which aren't bounded to a specific nic.<br>
Using this resource, nic-less networks could be configured on host.
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networklabels/
* '''GET''' - list host network labels
* '''POST''' - add a label to the host

  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networklabels/{networklabel:id}
* '''GET''' - returns a specific host network label
* '''DELETE''' - removes a specific host network label

'''pros''': Using host level network labels we can support nic-less networks auto-provision<br>
'''cons''': The management of labels becomes more complex, cannot use same label for nics<br>

* Due to the nature of nicless networks, those networks will be banned from the setupnics api acion.
