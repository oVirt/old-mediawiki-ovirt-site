== Install FC16 x86_64 ==
http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/16/Live/x86_64/Fedora-16-x86_64-Live-Desktop.iso

== Install oVirt-engine ==
[[Building_Ovirt_Engine]]

== Start the engine ==
 <nowiki>
  ${JBOSS_HOME}/bin/run.sh -b 0.0.0.0
 </nowiki>

== Install VDSM ==

 <nowiki>
  $>sudo yum install fence-agents libvirt libvirt-python nfs-utils qemu-img qemu-kvm
 </nowiki>

Download and install all of the rpms found in http://fsimonce.fedorapeople.org/vdsm/fedora-16/x86_64

create /etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf with the following:

 <nowiki>
  [vars]
  ssl = False
 </nowiki>

 <nowiki>
  $> sudo chkconfig vdsmd on
  $> sudo systemctl start vdsmd.service
 </nowiki>

== Create the network Bridge ==

ovirt-engine will expect the host to have a bridge named 'engine'.  Messing with network setting can sometimes result in complete loss of connectivity. Ensure that you have direct console access before starting this. To create the bridge do the following:

Add the bridge for your network interface. if your interface is named em1, edit the file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-em1
It should look like this:
 <nowiki>
  DEVICE=em1
  ONBOOT=yes
  HWADDR=<your mac address>
  BRIDGE=engine
  BOOTPROTO=none
 </nowiki>

Next create the file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-engine with the following contents:

 <nowiki>
  DEVICE=engine
  TYPE=Bridge
  BOOTPROTO=dhcp
  ONBOOT=yes
  DELAY=0
  NM_CONTROLLED=no
  MTU=1500 
 </nowiki>

Once this is done, restart networking and ensure that the bridge exists.


== Register The Host ==
 <nowiki>
  curl -X POST -d "<host><name>${hostname}</name><address>${ipaddress}</address><root_password>${password}</root_password></host>" --header "Content-Type: application/xml" -u 'admin@internal:letmein!' http://${server}:${port}/api/hosts
 </nowiki>

== Associate the Host with A Data Center ==

== Create NFS Storage ==
VDSM will not work with NFS v4 so ensure that you are configured to prevent the use of NFS v4.  You should create three nfs shares, one for each type of storage domain: data, iso and import/export.

Information on how to create nfs shares can be found at http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Administration_Guide_Draft/NFS
