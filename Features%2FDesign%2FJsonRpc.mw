== Introduce Messaged communication to VDSM using JSON-RPC on top of various transport protocols ==

{{Feature|name=Introduce Messaged communication to VDSM using JSON-RPC on top of various transport protocols|modules=vdsm, engine|status=In Development|version=3.5.0}}

=== Summary ===
Using a phased approach we are going to a point where messaging is the main communication model between the engine and VDSM as well as the numerous VDSM subsystems.
The biggest difference between current implementation and the goal is communication model change from synchronous http to asynchronous tcp. Xml message format is going to be replaced with json which will reduce parsing time.

=== Phases ===

=== Phase 0 ===
Below is prior state to the messaging changes.  The engine uses XML-RPC over HTTP to communicate with the VDSM. There are two connections active between the engine and a VDSM.

=== Phase 1 ===
This phase is intermediate development milestone which is not meant to be released. It makes introduction of new protocols easier and it paves the way for engine/vdms asynchronous communication. VDSM would listen on a different port for each supported transport. 

The engine sends messages by using one of the protocol reactors or apache http client for xml-rpc. VDSM parses messages using appropriate transport reactor and the message body is passed to the JSON-RPC Server for processing. The Server parses json data and calls the appropriate method on the bridge which is mapped to corresponding vdsm object responsible for performing the command.

AMQP protocol is available but not usable due to instability of the protocol implementation used.

==== Phase 2 ====
'''in progress'''

For this phase the main addition is protocol detection.
Instead of having a dedicated port per protocol the protocol detector handles SSL negotiation and peeks at the stream. After detecting the protocol it passes the socket to the correct part of the system.

This is going to be released for 3.5

==== Phase 3 ====

The main edition for this phase is the broker.
Up until this point the messaging reactors "faked" having a brokering semantics.
This change adds an actual entity with brokering semantics.

Broker Features:
* Topics
* Subscriptions

Low Priority Features:
* Queues
* Message acknowledgment\settlement
* Retrying policy


There is a possibility this phase would be skipped and we would just use a ready made broker.

==== Phase 4 ====

At this point Subsystems would start managing their own topics. There would still be the legacy interface but there will be a move towards a segmented and seperate task management per subsystem.

==== Phase 5 ====

At this point the broker will be pulled out (if we are not already using a standard broker. We remove the XML-RPC interface entirely and more subsystems are being seperated.

Hopefully some subsystems are even running in their own processes.
