== Introduce Messaged communication to VDSM using JSON-RPC on top of various transport protocols ==

{{Feature|name=Introduce Messaged communication to VDSM using JSON-RPC on top of various transport protocols|modules=vdsm, engine|status=In Development|version=3.5.0}}

=== Summary ===
Using a phased approach we are going to move VDSM to a point where messaging is the main communication model between the engine and VDSM as well as the numerous VDSM subsystems.

=== Phases ===

==== Phase 0 ====
The is how VDSM communicated with the engine before any messaging was implemented.

The engine uses XML-RPC over HTTP to make API requests.

==== Phase 1 ====
This is an phase not meant to be released in any version. Instead it it is meant to be used in development so integration with the engine could start.

VDSM would listen in a different port for each supported transport.
Messages are parsed by the appropriate transport reactor and the message boydy is passed to the JSON-RPC Server.
The Server than parses the json data and calls the appropriate method on the bridge that maps to the vdsm object responsible for performing the command.
