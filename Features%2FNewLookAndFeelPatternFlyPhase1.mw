== New Look and Feel based on PatternFly -- Phase 1 ==

{{Feature|name=New Look and Feel based on PatternFly -- Phase 1|modules=webadmin,userportal|status=In Development|version=3.5.0}}

=== Summary ===
We are updating the look and feel of oVirt using [http://www.patternfly.org PatternFly], the open interface project. The new look and feel aims to maintain the colors and spirit associated with oVirt, while updating it with a new, modern, sleek, and minimal look. The minimal design allows complex screens to look cleaner and airier, and lets the user focus on the data and the tasks by removing all extraneous visual elements. The use of color is very judicious and limited to where it truly adds value. Besides that, the style is cool, flat, and graphic. The interactions and behaviors remain unchanged, and the scope of this feature is limited to visual updates.

For Phase I of this project, we will apply the new look and feel to the following parts of oVirt:
* Welcome Page
* 404 Page
* Login Page (web admin/user portal)
* Top Banner (web admin/user portal)
