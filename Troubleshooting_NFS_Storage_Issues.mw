== Introduction ==
oVirt currently requires that NFS exports be configured in a specific way. This page is an attempt to list those requirements and assist with troubleshooting issues encountered when trying to attach an NFS storage domain to the oVirt environment for the first time.

* The NFS server must support NFSv3. oVirt 3.0 does not support NFSv4, while oVirt 4.0 does support NFSv4. To force an NFS client to use NFSv3, add this option to the configuration file ('''/etc/nfsmount.conf'''):

 <nowiki>Nfsvers=3</nowiki>

* To disable NFSv4 on an NFS server, add this option to the configuration file ('''/etc/sysconfig/nfs'''):

 <nowiki>NFS4_SUPPORT="no"</nowiki>

== Permissions ==
* Basically the exported directory must be readable and writeable for the user '''vdsm''' that has the uid '''36''' and gid '''36'''. Nevertheless some daemons on the hypervisor hosts (e.g. sanlock) use a different user id but need access to the directory too. The advise is to map all incoming NFS requests to the mentioned uid/gid. Two steps are required to ensure this:
** Chown the directory being exported 36:36.
** Add the '''anonuid=36''', '''anongid=36''' and '''all_squash''' options on the export in '''/etc/exports'''. 
 <nowiki>/exports/yourexportdirectory       *(rw,anonuid=36,anongid=36,all_squash)</nowiki>
* The exported directory should have permissions '''0755''':
* The NFS server must actually be running. 
** Ensure that the '''nfs''' and '''rpcbind''' services are running on the NFS server, Fedora 16 users should instead look for the '''netfs''' service.
** Ensure that '''showmount -e ''<nfs_server_ip>''''' shows the expected export(s).
=== SELinux ===
* Ensure that selinux is not interfering with NFS access. 
** getsebool -a | grep virt_use_nfs should show virt_use_nfs --> on, if not then do `setsebool  virt_use_nfs 1` to allow NFS access for VMs
** One can also use `setsebool  -P virt_use_nfs 1` to make this setting persistent across reboots.

The easiest way to definitively test that an NFS export is ready for use by oVirt is to:

* Create the '''vdsm''' user with uid '''36''' on the ovirt-engine host if it does not already exist.
* Change to the '''vdsm''' user using  '''su - vdsm -s /bin/bash''' 
* Attempt to mount the export on a temporary directory (for example, /tmpmnt) using the following command form: '''/usr/bin/sudo -n /bin/mount -t nfs -o soft,nosharecache,timeo=600,retrans=6,nfsvers=3 ''servername:/path/of/export'' /tmpmnt'''
* If the mount succeeds, then try to create a file in it via the '''touch''' command, i.e. '''touch /tmpmnt/tempfile'''

== nfs-check program ==
A new '''nfs-check''' script is now available to test whether an NFS export is ready for use by oVirt :

* '''nfs-check.py''' is a python script to validate nfs targets to use with oVirt project. Some operations include: mount the nfs target, create a file as vdsm:kvm and then remove it.
* '''nfs-check.py''' is available in the '''vdsm/contrib/''' directory of the vdsm source
* Run it on a node via '''python nfs-check.py ''server:/target'' '''

 <nowiki>
 $ git clone http://gerrit.ovirt.org/p/vdsm.git
 $ cd vdsm/contrib
 $ python nfs-check.py myNFSServer:/nfsTarget
</nowiki>

== Setting NFS Server ==
=== Debian Squeeze ===
 <nowiki>#> groupadd kvm -g 36
#> useradd vdsm -u 36 -g kvm

# mkdir /storage

# chmod 0755 /storage
# chown 36:36 /storage/

# cat /etc/exports
/storage    *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,all_squash,anonuid=36,anongid=36)

# /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart </nowiki>


=== Fedora 16 or higher  ===
 <nowiki>#> groupadd kvm -g 36
#> useradd vdsm -u 36 -g kvm

# mkdir /storage

# chmod 0755 /storage
# chown 36:36 /storage/

# yum -y install nfs-utils

# cat /etc/exports
/storage    *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,all_squash,anonuid=36,anongid=36)

# systemctl start rpcbind.service
# systemctl start nfs-server.service
# systemctl start nfs-lock.service 

# systemctl enable rpcbind.service
# systemctl enable nfs-server.service
# systemctl enable nfs-lock.service</nowiki>

=== RHEL6 based distro ===
 <nowiki>#> groupadd kvm -g 36
#> useradd vdsm -u 36 -g kvm

# mkdir /storage

# chmod 0755 /storage
# chown 36:36 /storage/

# cat /etc/exports
/storage    *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,all_squash,anonuid=36,anongid=36)

# /etc/init.d/nfs restart </nowiki>

= Workarounds for known issues =
== NFS Lockups ==
Normally the NFS server of any distro should work out of the box. Using older NFS servers or following different tuning advices 
throughout the internet may lead to a misconfiguration that gives lockups/freezes/stalls. Rule of thumb is to always ensure that 
the tcp window size parameters of your server are larger than the wsize and rsize mount option of your hypervisor hosts. E.g. using
Fedora 19 as a hypervisor node these parameters are set to 1 MB.
 
 <nowiki> # df
...
10.10.30.253:/var/nas3/ovirt on /rhev/data-center/mnt/10.10.30.253:_var_nas3_ovirt type nfs (...,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,...)
...
 </nowiki>

In this case it is a good idea to set the tcp window parameters on the NFS server to at least 4 MB in /etc/sysctl.conf.  

 <nowiki> # cat /etc/sysctl.conf
net.ipv4.tcp_mem=4096 65536 4194304
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem=4096 65536 4194304
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem=4096 65536 4194304
net.core.rmem_max=8388608
net.core.wmem_max=8388608
 </nowiki>

To activate these settings for the running server reload them with

 <nowiki> # sysctl -p </nowiki>

== NFS Storage Domain Failure on Fedora 17 ==
In the past, nodes running Fedora 17 kernels newer than 3.4 have trouble with NFS storage domains.<br>  
This issue has been fixed in: vdsm-4.10.0-10.fc17 <br>
Download: http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=358280<br>
More info: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=845660#c29<br>

In case, you still use vdsm < 4.10.0-10, the workaround is to use the 3.4 kernel in F17.<br>
You can use grub2's SAVEDEFAULT option to keep the endpoint booted on 3.4.<br>

* Confirm you have a 3.4 kernel
 <nowiki> # rpm -qa | grep kernel-3.4
kernel-3.4.0-1.fc17.x86_64 </nowiki>
* Update default grub config to ensure 'saved default' works
 <nowiki>
$EDITOR /etc/default/grub
 </nowiki>
* Ensure you have the following two lines
 <nowiki>
GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true
GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
 </nowiki>
* Generate new grub config
 <nowiki>
# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
 </nowiki>
* Reboot your system
 <nowiki>
# reboot
 </nowiki>
* Interrupt boot sequence and select the 3.4 kernel under the 'Advanced' menu.
* Login and confirm you're running 3.4
 <nowiki>
# uname -a
Linux ichigo-dom228 3.4.0-1.fc17.x86_64 #1 SMP Sun Jun 3 06:35:17 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
 </nowiki>
* Reboot once more and let it boot back up by itself and confirm it selected the 3.4 kernel
