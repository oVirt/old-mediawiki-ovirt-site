== Installing the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager ==

'''Overview'''

The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager can be installed under one of two arrangements - a standard setup in which the Manager is installed on an independent physical machine or virtual machine, or a self-hosted engine setup in which the Manager runs on a virtual machine that the Manager itself controls.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Important:''' While the prerequisites for and basic configuration of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager itself are the same for both standard and self-hosted engine setups, the process for setting up a self-hosted engine is different from that of a standard setup.</div>

'''Prerequisites'''

Before installing the Red Hat Virtualization Manager, you must ensure that you meet all the prerequisites. To complete installation of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager successfully, you must also be able to determine:

<ol>
<li>The ports to be used for HTTP and HTTPS communication. The defaults ports are <code>80</code> and <code>443</code> respectively.</li>
<li>The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the system on which the Manager is to be installed.</li>
<li>The password you use to secure the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization administration account.</li>
<li>The location of the database server to be used. You can use the setup script to install and configure a local database server or use an existing remote database server. To use a remote database server you must know:
<ul>
<li>The host name of the system on which the remote database server exists.</li>
<li>The port on which the remote database server is listening.</li>
<li>That the <code>uuid-ossp</code> extension had been loaded by the remote database server.</li></ul>

You must also know the user name and password of a user that is known to the remote database server. The user must have permission to create databases in PostgreSQL.</li>
<li>The organization name to use when creating the Manager's security certificates.</li>
<li>The storage type to be used for the initial data center attached to the Manager. The default is NFS.</li>
<li>The path to use for the ISO share, if the Manager is being configured to provide one. The display name, which will be used to label the domain in the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager also needs to be provided.</li>
<li>The firewall rules, if any, present on the system that need to be integrated with the rules required for the Manager to function.</li></ol>

'''Configuration'''

Before installation is completed the values selected are displayed for confirmation. Once the values have been confirmed they are applied and the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is ready for use.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' Automated installations are created by providing <code>engine-setup</code> with an answer file. An answer file contains answers to the questions asked by the setup command.</div>

<ul>
<li><p>To create an answer file, use the ''<code>--generate-answer</code>'' parameter to specify a path and file name with which to create the answer file. When this option is specified, the <code>engine-setup</code> command records your answers to the questions in the setup process to the answer file.</p>
<pre class="screen"># engine-setup --generate-answer=[ANSWER_FILE]</pre></li>
<li><p>To use an answer file for a new installation, use the ''<code>--config-append</code>'' parameter to specify the path and file name of the answer file to be used. The <code>engine-setup</code> command will use the answers stored in the file to complete the installation.</p>
<pre class="screen"># engine-setup --config-append=[ANSWER_FILE]</pre></li></ul>

Run <code>engine-setup --help</code> for a full list of parameters.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' Offline installation requires the creation of a software repository local to your Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. This software repository must contain all of the packages required to install Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager, Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtualization hosts, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machines. To create such a repository, see the ''Installing Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Offline'' technical brief, available at [https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/techbriefs/installing-red-hat-enterprise-virtualization-offline-rhev-30 https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/techbriefs/installing-red-hat-enterprise-virtualization-offline-rhev-30].</div>

== Installing the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager ==

=== Configuring an Offline Repository for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Installation ===

This task documents the creation of an offline repository containing all packages needed to install a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. Follow these steps to create a repository you can use to install Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization components on systems without a direct connection to Red Hat Network.

<ol>
<li><p>'''Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux'''</p>
<p>Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Server on a system that has access to Red Hat Network. This system downloads all required packages, and distribute them to your offline system(s).</p>
<p>'''Important'''</p>
<p>Ensure that the system used has a large amount of free disk space available. This procedure downloads a large number of packages, and requires up to 1.5 GB of free disk space.</p></li>
<li><p>'''Register Red Hat Enterprise Linux'''</p>
<p>Register the system with Red Hat Network (RHN) using either Subscription Manager or RHN Classic.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>'''Subscription Manager'''</p>
<p>Use the <code>subscription-manager</code> command as <code>root</code> with the ''<code>register</code>'' parameter.</p>
<pre class="screen"># subscription-manager register</pre></li>
<li><p>'''RHN Classic'''</p>
<p>Use the <code>rhn_register</code> command as <code>root</code>.</p>
<pre class="screen"># rhn_register</pre></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>'''Add required channel subscriptions'''</p>
<p>Subscribe the system for all channels listed in the ''Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization - Installation Guide''.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>'''Subscription Manager'''</p></li>
<li><p>'''RHN Classic'''</p></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>'''Configure File Transfer Protocol (FTP) access'''</p>
<p>Servers that are not connected to the Internet can access the software repository using File Transfer Protocol (FTP). To create the FTP repository you must install and configure vsftpd, while logged in to the system as the <code>root</code> user:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>'''Install vsftpd'''</p>
<p>Install the vsftpd package.</p>
<pre class="screen"># yum install vsftpd</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Start vsftpd'''</p>
<p>Start the <code>vsftpd</code> daemon.</p>
<pre class="screen"># chkconfig vsftpd on    service vsftpd start</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Create sub-directory'''</p>
<p>Create a sub-directory inside the <code>/var/ftp/pub/</code> directory. This is where the downloaded packages will be made available.</p>
<pre class="screen"># mkdir /var/ftp/pub/rhevrepo</pre></li></ol>
</li>
<li><p>'''Download packages'''</p>
<p>Once the FTP server has been configured, you must use the <code>reposync</code> command to download the packages to be shared. It downloads all packages from all configured software repositories. This includes repositories for all Red Hat Network channels the system is subscribed to, and any locally configured repositories.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>As the <code>root</code> user, change into the <code>/var/ftp/pub/rhevrepo</code> directory.</p>
<pre class="screen"># cd /var/ftp/pub/rhevrepo</pre></li>
<li><p>Run the <code>reposync</code> command.</p>
<pre class="screen"># reposync --plugins .</pre></li></ol>
</li>
<li><p>'''Create local repository metadata'''</p>
<p>Use the <code>createrepo</code> command to create repository metadata for each of the sub-directories where packages were downloaded under <code>/var/ftp/pub/rhevrepo</code>.</p>
<pre class="screen"># for DIR in `find /var/ftp/pub/rhevrepo -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d`; do createrepo $DIR; done;</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Create repository configuration files'''</p>
<p>Create a <code>yum</code> configuration file, and copy it to the <code>/etc/yum.repos.d/</code> directory on client systems that you want to connect to this software repository. Ensure that the system hosting the repository is connected to the same network as the client systems where the packages are to be installed.</p>
<p>The configuration file can be created manually, or using a script. If using a script, then before running it you must replace <code>ADDRESS</code> in the ''<code>baseurl</code>'' with the IP address or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the system hosting the repository. The script must be run on this system and then distributed to the client machines. For example:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">#!/bin/sh

REPOFILE=&quot;/etc/yum.repos.d/rhev.repo&quot;

for DIR in `find /var/ftp/pub/rhevrepo -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d`; do  
    echo -e &quot;[`basename $DIR`]&quot;   &gt; $REPOFILE  
    echo -e &quot;name=`basename $DIR`&quot; &gt;&gt; $REPOFILE 
    echo -e &quot;baseurl=ftp://ADDRESS/pub/rhevrepo/`basename $DIR`&quot; &gt;&gt; $REPOFILE   
    echo -e &quot;enabled=1&quot; &gt;&gt; $REPOFILE  
    echo -e &quot;gpgcheck=0&quot; &gt;&gt; $REPOFILE 
    echo -e &quot;\n&quot; &gt;&gt; $REPOFILE
done;</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Copy the repository configuration file to client system'''</p>
<p>Copy the repository configuration file to the <code>/etc/yum.repos.d/</code> directory on every system that you want to connect to this software repository. For example: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager system(s), all Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtualization hosts, and all Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machines.</p></li></ol>

Now that your client systems have been configured to use your local repository, you can proceed with management server, virtualization host, and virtual machine installation as documented in the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization product documentation. Instead of installing packages from Red Hat Network, you can install them from your newly created local repository.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' You can also provide the software repository created here to client systems using removable media, such as a portable USB drive. To do this, first create the repository using the steps provided, and then:

# Recursively copy the <code>/var/ftp/pub/rhevrepo</code> directory, and all its contents, to the removable media.
# Modify the <code>/etc/yum.repos.d/rhev.repo</code> file, replacing the <code>baseurl</code> values with the path to which the removable media will be mounted on the client systems. For example <code>file:///media/disk/rhevrepo/</code>.</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' As updated packages are released to Red Hat Network - addressing security issues, fixing bugs, and adding enhancements - you must update your local repository. To do this, repeat the procedure for synchronizing and sharing the channels. Adding the ''<code>--newest-only</code>'' parameter to the <code>reposync</code> command ensures that it only retrieves the newest version of each available package. Once the repository is updated you must ensure it is available to each of your client systems and then run <code>yum update</code> on it.</div>

=== Installing the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Packages ===

'''Summary'''

Before you can configure and use the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager, you must install the rhevm package and dependencies.

'''Procedure 1.1. Installing the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Packages'''

<ol>
<li><p>To ensure all packages are up to date, run the following command on the machine where you are installing the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager:</p>
<pre class="screen"># yum update</pre></li>
<li><p>Run the following command to install the rhevm package and dependencies.</p>
<pre class="screen"># yum install rhevm</pre>
<p>'''Note'''</p>
<p>The rhevm-doc package is installed as a dependency of the rhevm package, and provides a local copy of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization documentation suite. This documentation is also used to provide context sensitive help links from the Administration and User Portals. You can run the following commands to search for translated versions of the documentation:</p>
<pre class="screen"># yum search rhevm-doc</pre></li></ol>

'''Result'''

You have installed the rhevm package and dependencies.

===  Configuring the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager ===

After you have installed the rhevm package and dependencies, you must configure the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager using the <code>engine-setup</code> command. This command asks you a series of questions and, after you provide the required values for all questions, applies that configuration and starts the <code>ovirt-engine</code> service.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' The <code>engine-setup</code> command guides you through several distinct configuration stages, each comprising several steps that require user input. Suggested configuration defaults are provided in square brackets; if the suggested value is acceptable for a given step, press '''Enter''' to accept that value.</div>

⁠

'''Procedure 1.2. Configuring the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager'''

<ol>
<li><p>'''Packages'''</p>
<p>The <code>engine-setup</code> command checks to see if it is performing an upgrade or an installation, and whether any updates are available for the packages linked to the Manager. No user input is required at this stage.</p>
<pre class="screen">[ INFO  ] Checking for product updates...
[ INFO  ] No product updates found</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Network Configuration'''</p>
<p>A reverse lookup is performed on the host name of the machine on which the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is being installed. The host name is detected automatically, but you can correct this host name if it is incorrect or if you are using virtual hosts. There must be forward and reverse lookup records for the provided host name in DNS, especially if you will also install the reports server.</p>
<pre class="screen">Host fully qualified DNS name of this server [autodetected host name]:</pre>
<p>The <code>engine-setup</code> command checks your firewall configuration and offers to modify that configuration for you to open the ports used by the Manager for external communication such as TCP ports 80 and 443. If you do not allow the <code>engine-setup</code> command to modify your firewall configuration, then you must manually open the ports used by the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.</p>
<pre class="screen">Do you want Setup to configure the firewall? (Yes, No) [Yes]:</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Database Configuration'''</p>
<p>You can use either a local or remote PostgreSQL database. The <code>engine-setup</code> command can configure your database automatically (including adding a user and a database), or it can use values that you supply.</p>
<pre class="screen">Where is the database located? (Local, Remote) [Local]: 
Setup can configure the local postgresql server automatically for the engine to run. This may conflict with existing applications.
Would you like Setup to automatically configure postgresql and create Engine database, or prefer to perform that manually? (Automatic, Manual) [Automatic]:</pre></li>
<li><p>'''oVirt Engine Configuration'''</p>
<p>Select '''Gluster''', '''Virt''', or '''Both''':</p>
<pre class="screen">Application mode (Both, Virt, Gluster) [Both]:</pre>
<p>'''Both''' offers the greatest flexibility.</p>
<p>Choose the initial data center storage type. You can have many data centers in your environment, each with a different type of storage; this is the storage type of your first data center:</p>
<pre class="screen">Default storage type: (NFS, FC, ISCSI, POSIXFS) [NFS]:</pre>
<p>Set a password for the automatically created administrative user of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager:</p>
<pre class="screen">Engine admin password:
Confirm engine admin password:</pre></li>
<li><p>'''PKI Configuration'''</p>
<p>The Manager uses certificates to communicate securely with its hosts. You provide the organization name for the certificate. This certificate can also optionally be used to secure https communications with the Manager.</p>
<pre class="screen">Organization name for certificate [autodetected domain-based name]:</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Apache Configuration'''</p>
<p>By default, external SSL (HTTPS) communication with the Manager is secured with the self-signed certificate created in the PKI configuration stage to securely communicate with hosts. Another certificate may be chosen for external HTTPS connections, without affecting how the Manager communicates with hosts.</p>
<pre class="screen">Setup can configure apache to use SSL using a certificate issued from the internal CA.
Do you wish Setup to configure that, or prefer to perform that manually? (Automatic, Manual) [Automatic]:</pre>
<p>The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager uses the Apache web server to present a landing page to users. The <code>engine-setup</code> command can make the landing page of the Manager the default page presented by Apache.</p>
<pre class="screen">Setup can configure the default page of the web server to present the application home page. This may conflict with existing applications.
Do you wish to set the application as the default web page of the server? (Yes, No) [Yes]:</pre></li>
<li><p>'''System Configuration'''</p>
<p>The <code>engine-setup</code> command can create an NFS share on the Manager to use as an ISO storage domain. Hosting the ISO domain locally to the Manager simplifies keeping some elements of your environment up to date.</p>
<pre class="screen">Configure an NFS share on this server to be used as an ISO Domain? (Yes, No) [Yes]: 
Local ISO domain path [/var/lib/exports/iso]: 
Local ISO domain ACL [0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0(rw)]: 
Local ISO domain name [ISO_DOMAIN]:</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Websocket Proxy Server Configuration'''</p>
<p>The <code>engine-setup</code> command can optionally configure a websocket proxy server for allowing users to connect to virtual machines via the noVNC or HTML 5 consoles.</p>
<pre class="screen">Configure WebSocket Proxy on this machine? (Yes, No) [Yes]:</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Miscellaneous Configuration'''</p>
<p>You can use the <code>engine-setup</code> command to allow a proxy server to broker transactions from the Red Hat Access plug-in.</p>
<pre class="screen">Would you like transactions from the Red Hat Access Plugin sent from the RHEV Manager to be brokered through a proxy server? (Yes, No) [No]:</pre>
<pre class="screen">[ INFO  ] Stage: Setup validation</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Configuration Preview'''</p>
<p>Check the configuration preview to confirm the values you entered before they are applied. If you choose to proceed, <code>engine-setup</code> configures the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager using those values.</p>
<pre class="screen">Engine database name                    : engine

'''Result'''

The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager has been configured and is running on your server. You can log in to the Administration Portal as the <code>admin@internal</code> user to continue configuring the Manager. Furthermore, the <code>engine-setup</code> command saves your answers to a file that can be used to reconfigure the Manager using the same values.

===  Preparing a PostgreSQL Database for Use with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager ===

'''Summary'''

You can manually configure a database server to host the database used by the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager. The database can be hosted either locally on the machine on which the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is installed, or remotely on another machine.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Important:''' The database must be prepared prior to running the <code>engine-setup</code> command.</div>

⁠

'''Procedure 1.3. Preparing a PostgreSQL Database for use with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager'''

<ol>
<li><p>Run the following commands to initialize the PostgreSQL database, start the <code>postgresql</code> service and ensure this service starts on boot:</p>
<pre class="screen"># service postgresql initdb
# service postgresql start
# chkconfig postgresql on</pre></li>
<li><p>Create a user for the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager to use when it writes to and reads from the database, and a database in which to store data about the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. You must perform this step on both local and remote databases. Use the '''psql''' terminal as the <code>postgres</code> user.</p>
<pre class="screen"># su - postgres
$ psql              
postgres=# create role [user name] with login encrypted password '[password]';
postgres=# create database [database name] owner [user name] template template0 encoding 'UTF8' lc_collate 'en_US.UTF-8' lc_ctype 'en_US.UTF-8';</pre></li>
<li><p>Run the following commands to connect to the new database and add the <code>plpgsql</code> language:</p>
<pre class="screen">postgres=# \c [database name]
CREATE LANGUAGE plpgsql;</pre></li>
<li>Ensure the database can be accessed remotely by enabling client authentication. Edit the <code>/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf</code> file, and add the following in accordance with the location of the database:
<ul>
<li><p>For local databases, add the two following lines immediately underneath the line starting with <code>Local</code> at the bottom of the file:</p>
<pre class="screen">host    [database name]    [user name]    0.0.0.0/0  md5
host    [database name]    [user name]    ::0/0      md5</pre></li>
<li><p>For remote databases, add the following line immediately underneath the line starting with <code>Local</code> at the bottom of the file, replacing ''X.X.X.X'' with the IP address of the Manager:</p>
<pre class="screen">host    [database name]    [user name]    X.X.X.X/32   md5</pre></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>Allow TCP/IP connections to the database. You must perform this step for remote databases. Edit the <code>/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf</code> file and add the following line:</p>
<pre class="screen">listen_addresses='*'</pre>
<p>This example configures the <code>postgresql</code> service to listen for connections on all interfaces. You can specify an interface by giving its IP address.</p></li>
<li><p>Restart the <code>postgresql</code> service. This step is required on both local and remote manually configured database servers.</p>
<pre class="screen"># service postgresql restart</pre></li></ol>

'''Result'''

You have manually configured a PostgreSQL database to use with the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

===  Configuring the Manager to Use a Manually Configured Local or Remote PostgreSQL Database ===

'''Summary'''

During the database configuration stage of configuring the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager using the <code>engine-setup</code> script, you can choose to use a manually configured database. You can select to use a locally or remotely installed PostgreSQL database.

⁠

'''Procedure 1.4. Configuring the Manager to use a Manually Configured Local or Remote PostgreSQL Database'''

<ol>
<li><p>During configuration of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager, the <code>engine-setup</code> command prompts you to decide where your database is located:</p>
<pre class="screen">Where is the database located? (Local, Remote) [Local]:</pre>
<p>The steps involved in manually configuring the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manger to use local or remotely hosted databases are the same. However, to use a remotely hosted database you must provide the host name of the remote database server and the port on which it is listening.</p></li>
<li><p>When prompted, enter <code>Manual</code> to manually configure the database:</p>
<pre class="screen">Would you like Setup to automatically configure postgresql, or prefer to perform that manually? (Automatic, Manual) [Automatic]: Manual</pre></li>
<li><p>If you are using a remotely hosted database, supply the <code>engine-setup</code> command with the host name of your database server and the port on which it is listening:</p>
<pre class="screen">Database host [localhost]:
Database port [5432]:</pre></li>
<li><p>For both local and remotely hosted databases, you must select whether or not your database uses a secured connection. You must also enter the name of the database you configured, the user the Manager can use to access the database, and the password of that user.</p>
<pre class="screen">Database secured connection (Yes, No) [No]: 
Database name [engine]: 
Database user [engine]: 
Database password:</pre>
<p>'''Note'''</p>
<p>Using a secured connection to your database requires you to also have manually configured secured database connections.</p></li></ol>

'''Result'''

You have configured the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager to use a manually configured database. The <code>engine-setup</code> command continues with the rest of your environment configuration.

===  Connecting to the Administration Portal ===

'''Summary'''

Access the Administration Portal using a web browser.

⁠

'''Procedure 1.5. Connecting to the Administration Portal'''

<ol>
<li>Open a supported web browser.</li>
<li><p>Navigate to <code>https://[your-manager-fqdn]/ovirt-engine</code>, replacing ''[your-manager-fqdn]'' with the fully qualified domain name that you provided during installation to open the login screen.</p>
<p>'''Important'''</p>
<p>The first time that you connect to the Administration Portal, you are prompted to trust the certificate being used to secure communications between your browser and the web server.</p></li>
<li>Enter your '''User Name''' and '''Password'''. If you are logging in for the first time, use the user name <code>admin</code> in conjunction with the administrator password that you specified during installation.</li>
<li>Select the domain against which to authenticate from the '''Domain''' drop-down list. If you are logging in using the internal <code>admin</code> user name, select the <code>internal</code> domain.</li>
<li>You can view the Administration Portal in multiple languages. The default selection will be chosen based on the locale settings of your web browser. If you would like to view the Administration Portal in a language other than the default, select your preferred language from the list.</li>
<li>Click '''Login'''.</li></ol>

'''Result'''

You have logged into the Administration Portal.

===  Removing the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager ===

'''Summary'''

You can use the <code>engine-cleanup</code> command to remove specific components or all components of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.
⁠

= ⁠Chapter 2. The Self-Hosted Engine =

== About the Self-Hosted Engine ==

A self-hosted engine is a virtualized environment in which the engine, or Manager, runs on a virtual machine on the hosts managed by that engine. The virtual machine is created as part of the host configuration, and the engine is installed and configured in parallel to that host configuration process, referred to in these procedures as the deployment.

The virtual machine running the engine is created to be highly available. This means that if the host running the virtual machine goes into maintenance mode, or fails unexpectedly, the virtual machine will be migrated automatically to another host in the environment.

The primary benefit of the self-hosted engine is that it requires less hardware to deploy an instance of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization as the engine runs as a virtual machine, not on physical hardware. Additionally, the engine is configured to be highly available automatically, rather than requiring a separate cluster.

The self-hosted engine currently only runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 hosts. Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisors and older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux are not recommended for use with a self-hosted engine.

== Limitations of the Self-Hosted Engine ==

At present there are two main limitations of the self-hosted engine configuration:

* An NFS storage domain is required for the configuration. NFS is the only supported file system for the self-hosted engine.
* The host and hosted engine must use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 or above. Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisors are not supported.

'''Summary'''

When package installation is complete, the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager must be configured. The <code>hosted-engine</code> deployment script is provided to assist with this task. The script asks you a series of questions, and configures your environment based on your answers. When the required values have been provided, the updated configuration is applied and the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager services are started.

The <code>hosted-engine</code> deployment script guides you through several distinct configuration stages. The script suggests possible configuration defaults in square brackets. Where these default values are acceptable, no additional input is required.

This procedure requires a new Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 host with the ovirt-hosted-engine-setup package installed. This host is referred to as 'Host-HE1', with a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of <code>Host-HE1.example.com</code> in this procedure.

The hosted engine, the virtual machine created during configuration of Host-HE1 to manage the environment, is referred to as 'my-engine'. You will be prompted by the <code>hosted-engine</code> deployment script to access this virtual machine multiple times to install an operating system and to configure the engine.

All steps in this procedure are to be conducted as the <code>root</code> user for the specified machine.

'''Result'''

When the <code>hosted-engine</code> deployment script completes successfully, the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is configured and running on your server. In contrast to a bare-metal Manager installation, the hosted engine Manager has already configured the data center, cluster, host (Host-HE1), storage domain, and virtual machine of the hosted engine (HostedEngine-VM). You can log in as the '''admin@internal''' user to continue configuring the Manager and add further resources.

Link your Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager to a directory server so you can add additional users to the environment. Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization supports directory services from Red Hat Directory Services (RHDS), IdM, and Active Directory. Add a directory server to your environment using the <code>engine-manage-domains</code> command.

The <code>ovirt-host-engine-setup</code> script also saves the answers you gave during configuration to a file, to help with disaster recovery. If a destination is not specified using the <code>--generate-answer=&lt;file&gt;</code> argument, the answer file is generated at <code>/etc/ovirt-hosted-engine/answers.conf</code>.

Your original Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is referred to as 'BareMetal-Manager', with an FQDN of <code>Manager.example.com</code>, in this procedure. You are required to access and make changes on BareMetal-Manager during this procedure.

The hosted engine, the virtual machine created during configuration of Host-HE1 and used to manage the environment, is referred to as 'HostedEngine-VM' in this procedure. The <code>hosted-engine</code> deployment script prompts you to access this virtual machine multiple times to install an operating system and to configure the engine.

All steps in this procedure are to be conducted as the <code>root</code> user for the specified machine.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Important:''' The engine running on BareMetal-Manager must be the same version as will be installed on HostedEngine-VM. As the hosted engine feature is only available on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization version 3.3.0 and later, any previous version of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization running on BareMetal-Manager must be upgraded. Upgrade the engine version on BareMetal-Manager before creating the backup with the <code>engine-backup</code> command.</div>

[ INFO  ] Creating VM
You can now connect to the VM with the following command:
    /usr/bin/remote-viewer vnc://localhost:5900
Use temporary password &quot;5379skAb&quot; to connect to vnc console.
Please note that in order to use remote-viewer you need to be able to run graphical applications.
This means that if you are using ssh you have to supply the -Y flag (enables trusted X11 forwarding).
Otherwise you can run the command from a terminal in your preferred desktop environment.
If you cannot run graphical applications you can connect to the graphic console from another host or connect to the console using the following command:
virsh -c qemu+tls://Test/system console HostedEngine
If you need to reboot the VM you will need to start it manually using the command:
hosted-engine --vm-start
You can then set a temporary password using the command:
hosted-engine --add-console-password
Please install and setup the engine in the VM.
You may also be interested in subscribing to &quot;agent&quot; RHN/Satellite channel and installing rhevm-guest-agent-common package in the VM.
To continue make a selection from the options below:
          (1) Continue setup - engine installation is complete
          (2) Power off and restart the VM
          (3) Abort setup</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Installing the Manager'''</p>
<p>Connect to HostedEngine-VM, subscribe to the appropriate Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager channels, ensure that the most up-to-date versions of all installed packages are in use, and install the rhevm packages.</p>
<pre class="screen"># yum upgrade</pre>
<pre class="screen"># yum install rhevm</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Disabling BareMetal-Manager'''</p>
<p>Connect to BareMetal-Manager, the Manager of your established Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment, and stop the engine and prevent it from running.</p>
<pre class="screen"># service ovirt-engine stop
# service ovirt-engine disable
# chkconfig ovirt-engine off</pre>
<p>'''Note'''</p>
<p>Though stopping BareMetal-Manager from running is not obligatory, it is recommended as it ensures no changes will be made to the environment after the backup has been created. Additionally, it prevents BareMetal-Manager and HostedEngine-VM from simultaneously managing existing resources.</p></li>
<li><p>'''Updating DNS'''</p>
<p>Update your DNS so that the FQDN of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment correlates to the IP address of HostedEngine-VM and the FQDN previously provided when configuring the <code>hosted-engine</code> deployment script on Host-HE1. In this procedure, FQDN was set as ''Manager.example.com'' because in a migrated hosted-engine setup, the FQDN provided for the engine must be identical to that given in the engine setup of the original engine.</p></li>
<li><p>'''Creating a Backup of BareMetal-Manager'''</p>
<p>Connect to BareMetal-Manager and run the <code>engine-backup</code> command with the ''<code>--mode=backup</code>'', ''<code>--file=[FILE]</code>'', and ''<code>--log=[LogFILE]</code>'' parameters to specify the backup mode, the name of the backup file created and used for the backup, and the name of the log file to be created to store the backup log.</p>
<pre class="screen"># engine-backup --mode=backup --file=[FILE] --log=[LogFILE]</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Copying the Backup File to HostedEngine-VM'''</p>
<p>On BareMetal-Manager, secure copy the backup file to HostedEngine-VM. In the following example, ''[Manager.example.com]'' is the FQDN for HostedEngine-VM, and ''/backup/'' is any designated folder or path. If the designated folder or path does not exist, you must connect to HostedEngine-VM and create it before secure copying the backup from BareMetal-Manager.</p>
<pre class="screen"># scp -p backup1 [Manager.example.com:/backup/]</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Restoring the Backup File on HostedEngine-VM'''</p>
<p>The <code>engine-backup --mode=restore</code> command does not create a database; you are required to create one on HostedEngine-VM before restoring the backup you created on BareMetal-Manager. Connect to HostedEngine-VM and create the database, as detailed in [[#Preparing_a_Postgres_Database_Server_for_use_with_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization_Manager|Section 1.3.4, “Preparing a PostgreSQL Database for Use with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager”]].</p>
<p>'''Note'''</p>
<p>The procedure in [[#Preparing_a_Postgres_Database_Server_for_use_with_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization_Manager|Section 1.3.4, “Preparing a PostgreSQL Database for Use with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager”]] creates a database that is not empty, which will result in the following error when you attempt to restore the backup:</p>
<pre class="screen">FATAL: Database is not empty</pre>
<p>Create an empty database using the following command in psql:</p>
<pre class="screen">postgres=# create database [database name] owner [user name]</pre>
<p>After the empty database has been created, restore the BareMetal-Manager backup using the <code>engine-backup</code> command with the ''<code>--mode=restore</code>'' ''<code>--file=[FILE]</code>'' ''<code>--log=[Restore.log]</code>'' parameters to specify the restore mode, the name of the file to be used to restore the database, and the name of the logfile to store the restore log. This restores the files and the database but does not start the service.</p>
<p>To specify a different database configuration, use the ''<code>--change-db-credentials</code>'' parameter to activate alternate credentials. Use the <code>engine-backup --help</code> command on the Manager for a list of credential parameters.</p>
<pre class="screen"># engine-backup --mode=restore --file=[FILE] --log=[Restore.log] --change-db-credentials --db-host=[X.X.X.X] --db-user=[engine] --db-password=[password] --db-name=[engine]</pre></li>

'''Result'''

Your Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization engine has been migrated to a hosted-engine setup. The Manager is now operating on a virtual machine on Host-HE1, called HostedEngine-VM in the environment. As HostedEngine-VM is highly available, it is migrated to other hosts in the environment when applicable.

== Installing Additional Hosts to a Self-Hosted Environment ==

'''Summary'''

Adding additional nodes to a self-hosted environment is very similar to deploying the original host, though heavily truncated as the script detects the environment.

As with the original host, additional hosts require Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 with subscriptions to the appropriate Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization channels.

All steps in this procedure are to be conducted as the <code>root</code> user.

⁠

'''Procedure 2.3. Adding the host'''

<ol>
<li><p>Install the ovirt-hosted-engine-setup package.</p>
<pre class="screen"># yum install ovirt-hosted-engine-setup</pre></li>
<li><p>Configure the host with the deployment command.</p>
<pre class="screen"># hosted-engine --deploy</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Configuring Storage'''</p>
<p>Specify the storage type and the full address, using either the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or IP address, and path name of the shared storage domain used in the self-hosted environment.</p>
<pre class="screen">Please specify the storage you would like to use (nfs3, nfs4)[nfs3]:
Please specify the full shared storage connection path to use (example: host:/path): storage.example.com:/hosted_engine/nfs</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Detecting the Self-Hosted Engine'''</p>
<p>The <code>hosted-engine</code> script detects that the shared storage is being used and asks if this is an additional host setup. You are then prompted for the host ID, which must be an integer not already assigned to an additional host in the environment.</p>
<pre class="screen">The specified storage location already contains a data domain. Is this an additional host setup (Yes, No)[Yes]? 
[ INFO  ] Installing on additional host
Please specify the Host ID [Must be integer, default: 2]: </pre></li>
<li><p>'''Configuring the System'''</p>
<p>The <code>hosted-engine</code> script uses the answer file generated by the original hosted-engine setup. To achieve this, the script requires the FQDN or IP address and the password of the <code>root</code> user of that host so as to access and secure-copy the answer file to the additional host.</p>
<pre class="screen">[WARNING] A configuration file must be supplied to deploy Hosted Engine on an additional host.

Please confirm installation settings (Yes, No)[No]: </pre></li></ol>

'''Result'''

After confirmation, the script completes installation of the host and adds it to the environment.

== Maintaining the Self-Hosted Engine ==

Setting the engine to global maintenance enables you to start, stop, and modify the engine without interference from the high-availability agents. This must be applied to the engine for any setup or upgrade operations that require the engine to be stopped, for instance the installation of the rhevm-dwh and rhevm-reports packages necessary for the '''Reports Portal'''.

<pre class="screen"># hosted-engine --set-maintenance --mode=global</pre>
To resume the high-availability function of the engine, turn off global maintenance:

<pre class="screen"># hosted-engine --set-maintenance --mode=none</pre>
Both of these commands are to be conducted as the <code>root</code> user.

== Upgrading the Self-Hosted Engine ==

'''Error'''

Topic 30615 failed Injection processing and is not included in this build.

Please review the compiler error for [[#TagErrorXRef30615|Topic ID 30615]] for more detailed information.

== Upgrading Additional Hosts in a Self-Hosted Environment ==

'''Summary'''

It is recommended that all hosts in your self-hosted environment are upgraded at the same time. This prevents version 3.3 hosts from going into a '''Non Operational''' state. If this is not practical in your environment, follow this procedure to upgrade any additional hosts.

Ensure the host is not hosting the Manager virtual machine before beginning the procedure.

All commands in this procedure are as the <code>root</code> user.

⁠

'''Procedure 2.4. Upgrading Additional Hosts'''

<ol>
<li><p>Log into the host and set the maintenance mode to <code>local</code>.</p>
<pre class="screen"># hosted-engine --set-maintenance --mode=local</pre></li>
<li>Access the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Administration Portal. Select the host and put it into maintenance mode by clicking the '''Maintenance''' button.</li>
<li><p>Log into and update the host.</p>
<pre class="screen"># yum update</pre></li>
<li><p>Restart VDSM on the host.</p>
<pre class="screen"># service vdsmd restart</pre></li>
<li><p>Restart <code>ovirt-ha-broker</code> and <code>ovirt-ha-agent</code> on the host.</p>
<pre class="screen"># service ovirt-ha-broker restart</pre>
<pre class="screen"># service ovirt-ha-agent restart</pre></li>
<li><p>Turn off the hosted-engine maintenance mode on the host.</p>
<pre class="screen"># hosted-engine --set-maintenance --mode=none</pre></li>
<li>Access the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Administration Portal. Select the host and activate it by clicking the '''Activate''' button.</li></ol>

'''Result'''

You have updated an additional host in your self-hosted environment to Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.4.

= ⁠Chapter 3. History and Reports =

== Workflow Progress - Data Collection Setup and Reports Installation ==

[[Image:images/1192.png]]

== Data Collection Setup and Reports Installation Overview ==

The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager optionally includes a comprehensive management history database, which can be utilized by any application to extract a range of information at the data center, cluster, and host levels. As the database structure changes over time a number of database views are also included to provide a consistent structure to consuming applications. A view is a virtual table composed of the result set of a database query. The definition of a view is stored in the database as a <code>SELECT</code> statement. The result set of the <code>SELECT</code> statement populates the virtual table returned by the view. If the optional comprehensive management history database has been enabled, the history tables and their associated views are stored in the <code>ovirt_engine_history</code> database.

In addition to the history database Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports functionality is also available as an optional component. Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports provides a customized implementation of JasperServer and JasperReports. JasperServer is a component of JasperReports, an open source reporting tool capable of being embedded in Java-based applications. It produces reports which can be rendered to screen, printed, or exported to a variety of formats including PDF, Excel, CSV, Word, RTF, Flash, ODT and ODS. Reports built in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports are accessed via a web interface. In addition to a range of pre-configured reports and dashboards for monitoring the system, you are also able to create your own ad hoc reports.

Before proceeding with Red Hat Virtualization Manager Reports installation you must first have installed the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports functionality depends on the presence of the history database, which is installed separately. Both the history database and the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports are optional components. They are not installed by default when you install the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' Detailed user, administration, and installation guides for JasperReports can be found in <code>/usr/share/jasperreports-server-pro/docs/</code></div>

== Installing and Configuring the History Database and Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports ==

'''Summary'''

Use of the history database and reports is optional. To use the reporting capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager, you must install and configure rhevm-dwh and rhevm-reports.

⁠

'''Procedure 3.1. Installing and Configuring the History Database and Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports'''

<ol>
<li><p>Install the rhevm-dwh package. This package must be installed on the system on which the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is installed.</p>
<pre class="screen"># yum install rhevm-dwh</pre></li>
<li><p>Install the rhevm-reports package. This package must be installed on the system on which the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is installed.</p>
<pre class="screen"># yum install rhevm-reports</pre></li>
<li><p>Run the <code>engine-setup</code> command on the system hosting the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager and follow the prompts to install Data Warehouse and Reports:</p>
<pre class="screen">--== PRODUCT OPTIONS ==--
         
Install Data Warehouse on this host (Yes, No) [Yes]: 
Install Reports on this host (Yes, No) [Yes]:</pre></li>
<li><p>The command will prompt you to answer the following questions about the DWH database:</p>
<pre class="screen">--== DATABASE CONFIGURATION ==--
         
Where is the DWH database located? (Local, Remote) [Local]: 
Setup can configure the local postgresql server automatically for the DWH to run. This may conflict with existing applications.

Where is the Reports database located? (Local, Remote) [Local]: 
Setup can configure the local postgresql server automatically for the Reports to run. This may conflict with existing applications.
Would you like Setup to automatically configure postgresql and create Reports database, or prefer to perform that manually? (Automatic, Manual) [Automatic]:</pre>
<p>Press '''Enter''' to choose the highlighted defaults, or type your alternative preference and then press '''Enter'''.</p></li>
<li><p>The command will then prompt you to set the password for the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports administrative users (<code>admin</code> and <code>superuser</code>). Note that the reports system maintains its own set of credentials which are separate to those used for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.</p>
<pre class="screen">Reports power users password:</pre>
<p>You will be prompted to enter the password a second time to confirm it.</p></li>
<li><p>For the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports installation to take effect, the <code>ovirt-engine</code> service must be restarted. The <code>engine-setup</code> command prompts you:</p>
<pre class="screen">During execution engine service will be stopped (OK, Cancel) [OK]:</pre>
<p>Type '''OK''' and then press '''Enter''' to proceed. The <code>ovirt-engine</code> service will restart automatically later in the command.</p></li></ol>

'''Result'''

The <code>ovirt_engine_history</code> database has been created. Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is configured to log information to this database for reporting purposes. Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports has been installed successfully. Access Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports at <code>http://[demo.redhat.com]/ovirt-engine-reports</code>, replacing <code>[demo.redhat.com]</code> with the fully-qualified domain name of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager. If during Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager installation you selected a non-default HTTP port then append <code>:</code>''[port]'' to the URL, replacing ''[port]'' with the port that you chose.

Use the user name <code>admin</code> and the password you set during reports installation to log in for the first time. Note that the first time you log into Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports, a number of web pages are generated, and as a result your initial attempt to login may take some time to complete.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' Previously, the <code>admin</code> user name was <code>rhevm-admin</code>. If you are performing a clean installation, the user name is now <code>admin</code>. In you are performing an upgrade, the user name will remain <code>rhevm-admin</code>.</div>

== Workflow Progress - Installing Virtualization Hosts ==

[[Image:images/1193.png]]

== Introduction to Virtualization Hosts ==

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization supports both virtualization hosts which run the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor, and those which run Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Both types of virtualization host are able to coexist in the same Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment.

Prior to installing virtualization hosts you should ensure that:

* all virtualization hosts meet the hardware requirements, and
* you have successfully completed installation of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

Additionally you may have chosen to install the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports. This is not mandatory and is not required to commence installing virtualization hosts. Once you have completed the above tasks you are ready to install virtualization hosts.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Important:''' It is recommended that you install at least two virtualization hosts and attach them to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. Where you attach only one virtualization host you will be unable to access features such as migration which require redundant hosts.</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Important:''' The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is a closed system. Use a Red Hat Enterprise Linux host if additional rpms are required for your environment.</div>

= ⁠Chapter 5. Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor Hosts =

== Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor Installation Overview ==

Before commencing Hypervisor installation you must be aware that:

* The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor ''must'' be installed on a physical server. It must not be installed in a Virtual Machine.
* The installation process will reconfigure the selected storage device and destroy all data. Therefore, ensure that any data to be retained is successfully backed up before proceeding.
* All Hypervisors in an environment must have unique hostnames and IP addresses, in order to avoid network conflicts.
* Instructions for using Network (PXE) Boot to install the Hypervisor are contained in the ''Red Hat Enterprise Linux - Hypervisor Deployment Guide'', available at [https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/ https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/].
* Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisors can use Storage Attached Networks (SANs) and other network storage for storing virtualized guest images. However, a local storage device is required for installing and booting the Hypervisor.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor installations can be automated or conducted without interaction. This type of installation is only recommended for advanced users. See the ''Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization - Installation Guide'' for more information.</div>

== Installing the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor Disk Image ==

'''Summary'''

Before you can set up a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor, you must download the packages containing the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor disk image and tools for writing that disk image to USB storage devices or preparing that disk image for deployment via PXE.

⁠

'''Procedure 5.1. Installing the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor Disk Image'''

<ol>
<li>Enable the <code>Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor (v.6 x86_64)</code> repository:
<ul>
<li><p>With RHN Classic:</p>
<pre class="screen"># rhn-channel --add --channel=rhel-x86_64-server-6-rhevh</pre></li>
<li><p>With Subscription Manager, attach a <code>Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization</code> entitlement and run the following command:</p>
<pre class="screen"># subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-6-server-rhevh-rpms</pre></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>Run the following command to install the rhev-hypervisor6 package:</p>
<pre class="screen"># yum install rhev-hypervisor6</pre></li>
<li><p>Run the following command to install the livecd-tools package:</p>
<pre class="screen"># yum install livecd-tools</pre></li></ol>

'''Result'''

You have installed the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor disk image and the '''livecd-iso-to-disk''' and '''livecd-iso-to-pxeboot''' utilities. By default, the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor disk image is located in the <code>/usr/share/rhev-hypervisor/</code> directory.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 and later allows more than one version of the ISO image to be installed at one time. As such, <code>/usr/share/rhev-hypervisor/rhev-hypervisor.iso</code> is now a symbolic link to a uniquely-named version of the Hypervisor ISO image, such as <code>/usr/share/rhev-hypervisor/rhev-hypervisor-6.4-20130321.0.el6ev.iso</code>. Different versions of the image can now be installed alongside each other, allowing administrators to run and maintain a cluster on a previous version of the Hypervisor while upgrading another cluster for testing. Additionally, the symbolic link <code>/usr/share/rhev-hypervisor/rhevh-latest-6.iso</code>, is created. This links also targets the most recently installed version of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization ISO image.</div>

You can then use that USB device to start the machine on which the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor will be installed and install the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor operating system.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' Not all systems support booting from a USB storage device. Ensure the BIOS on the system on which you will install the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor supports this feature.</div>

===  Preparing USB Installation Media Using livecd-iso-to-disk ===

'''Summary'''

You can use the '''livecd-iso-to-disk''' utility included in the livecd-tools package to write a hypervisor or other disk image to a USB storage device. You can then use that USB storage device to start systems that support booting via USB and install the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor.

The basic syntax for the '''livecd-iso-to-disk''' utility is as follows:

<pre class="screen"># livecd-iso-to-disk [image] [device]</pre>
The ''[device]'' parameter is the path to the USB storage device on which to write the disk image. The ''[image]'' parameter is the path and file name of the disk image to write to the USB storage device. By default, the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor disk image is located at <code>/usr/share/rhev-hypervisor/rhev-hypervisor.iso</code> on the machine on which the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is installed. The '''livecd-iso-to-disk''' utility requires devices to be formatted with the <code>FAT</code> or <code>EXT3</code> file system.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' USB storage devices are sometimes formatted without a partition table. In this case, use a generic identifier for the storage device such as <code>/dev/sdb</code>. When a USB storage device is formatted with a partition table, use the path name to the device, such as <code>/dev/sdb1</code>.</div>

===  Preparing USB Installation Media Using dd ===

The '''dd''' utility can also be used to write a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor disk image to a USB storage device. The '''dd''' utility is available from the coreutils package, and versions of the '''dd''' utility are available on a wide variety of Linux and Unix operating systems. Windows users can obtain the '''dd''' utility by installing Red Hat Cygwin, a free Linux-like environment for Windows.

The basic syntax for the '''dd''' utility is as follows:

<pre class="screen"># dd if=[image] of=[device]</pre>
The ''[device]'' parameter is the path to the USB storage device on which the disk image will be written. The ''[image]'' parameter is the path and file name of the disk image to write to the USB storage device. By default, the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor disk image is located at <code>/usr/share/rhev-hypervisor/rhev-hypervisor.iso</code> on the machine on which the rhev-hypervisor6 package is installed. The '''dd''' command does not make assumptions as to the format of the device because it performs a low-level copy of the raw data in the selected image.

</li>
<li><p>'''Configuration Using a Password'''</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter a password in the '''Password''' field. It is recommended that you use a strong password. Strong passwords contain a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numeric and punctuation characters. They are six or more characters long and do not contain dictionary words.</li>
<li>Re-enter the password in the '''Confirm Password''' field.</li>
<li>Leave the '''Management Server''' and '''Management Server Port''' fields blank. As long as a password is set, allowing the Hypervisor to be added to the Manager later, these fields are not required.</li></ol>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>'''Save Configuration'''</p>
<p>To save the configuration select '''&lt;Save&gt;''' and press '''Enter'''.</p></li></ol>

'''Result'''

The '''oVirt Engine''' configuration has been updated.

== Adding Hypervisors to Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager ==

===  Using the Hypervisor ===

If the Hypervisor was configured with the address of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager, the Hypervisor reboots and is automatically registered with the Manager. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager interface displays the Hypervisor under the '''Hosts''' tab. To prepare the Hypervisor for use, it must be approved using Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

If the Hypervisor was configured without the address of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager, it must be added manually. To add the Hypervisor manually, you must have both the IP address of the machine upon which it was installed and the password that was set on the '''oVirt Engine''' screen during configuration.

===  Approving a Hypervisor ===

'''Summary'''

It is not possible to run virtual machines on a Hypervisor until the addition of it to the environment has been approved in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

⁠

'''Procedure 5.22. Approving a Hypervisor'''

# Log in to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Administration Portal.
# From the '''Hosts''' tab, click on the host to be approved. The host should currently be listed with the status of '''Pending Approval'''.
# Click the '''Approve''' button. The '''Edit and Approve Hosts''' dialog displays. You can use the dialog to set a name for the host, fetch its SSH fingerprint before approving it, and configure power management, where the host has a supported power management card. For information on power management configuration, refer to [[#Host_Power_Management_settings_explained|Section 7.6.2, “Host Power Management Settings Explained”]].
# Click '''OK'''. If you have not configured power management you will be prompted to confirm that you wish to proceed without doing so, click '''OK'''.

'''Result'''

The status in the '''Hosts''' tab changes to '''Installing''', after a brief delay the host status changes to '''Up'''.

'''Result'''

You have installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Server. You must complete additional configuration tasks before adding the virtualization host to your Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment.

== Configuring the Virtualization Host Firewall ==

'''Summary'''

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization requires a number of network ports to be open to support virtual machines and remote management of the virtualization host from the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager. You must follow this procedure to open the required network ports before attempting to add the virtualization host to the Manager.

The steps in the following procedure configure the default firewall in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, <code>iptables</code>, to allow traffic on the required network ports. This procedure replaces the host's existing firewall configuration with one that contains only the ports required by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization. If you have existing firewall rules with which this configuration must be merged, then you must do so by manually editing the rules defined in the <code>iptables</code> configuration file, <code>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</code>.

All commands in this procedure must be run as the <code>root</code> user.

⁠

'''Procedure 7.2. Configuring the Virtualization Host Firewall'''

<ol>
<li><p>'''Remove existing rules from the firewall configuration'''</p>
<p>Remove any existing firewall rules using the ''<code>--flush</code>'' parameter to the <code>iptables</code> command.</p>
<pre class="screen"># iptables --flush</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Add new firewall rules to configuration'''</p>
<p>Add the firewall rules required by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization using the ''<code>--append</code>'' parameter to the <code>iptables</code> command. The prompt character ('''#''') has been intentionally omitted from this list of commands to allow easy copying of the content to a script file or command prompt.</p>
<pre class="screen">iptables --append INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT -p tcp --dport 16514 -j ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT -p tcp --dport 54321 -j ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dports 5900:6923 -j ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dports 49152:49216 -j ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
iptables --append FORWARD -m physdev ! --physdev-is-bridged -j REJECT \
--reject-with icmp-host-prohibited</pre>
<p>'''Note'''</p>
<p>The provided <code>iptables</code> commands add firewall rules to accept network traffic on a number of ports. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Port <code>22</code> for '''SSH'''.</li>
<li>Ports <code>5900</code> to <code>6923</code> for guest console connections.</li>
<li>Port <code>16514</code> for '''libvirt''' virtual machine migration traffic.</li>
<li>Ports <code>49152</code> to <code>49216</code> for VDSM virtual machine migration traffic.</li>
<li>Port <code>54321</code> for the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.</li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>'''Save the updated firewall configuration'''</p>
<p>Run the following command to save the updated firewall configuration:</p>
<pre class="screen"># service iptables save</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Enable iptables service'''</p>
<p>Ensure the <code>iptables</code> service is configured to start on boot and has been restarted, or is started for the first time if it was not already running.</p>
<pre class="screen"># chkconfig iptables on
# service iptables restart</pre></li></ol>

'''Result'''

You have configured the virtualization host's firewall to allow the network traffic required by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization.

== Configuring Virtualization Host sudo ==

'''Summary'''

The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager uses '''sudo''' to perform operations as the <code>root</code> on the host. The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux configuration, stored in <code>/etc/sudoers</code>, contains values that allow this. If this file has been modified since Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation, then these values may have been removed. This procedure verifies that the required entry still exists in the configuration, and adds the required entry if it is not present.

⁠

'''Procedure 7.3. Configuring Virtualization Host sudo'''

<ol>
<li><p>'''Log in'''</p>
<p>Log in to the virtualization host as the <code>root</code> user.</p></li>
<li><p>'''Run visudo'''</p>
<p>Run the <code>visudo</code> command to open the <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file.</p>
<pre class="screen"># visudo</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Edit sudoers file'''</p>
<p>Read the configuration file, and verify that it contains these lines:</p>
<pre class="screen"># Allow root to run any commands anywhere 
root    ALL=(ALL)   ALL</pre>
<p>If the file does not contain these lines, add them and save the file using the VIM <code>:w</code> command.</p></li>
<li><p>'''Exit editor'''</p>
<p>Exit <code>visudo</code> using the VIM <code>:q</code> command.</p></li></ol>

'''Result'''

You have configured '''sudo''' to allow use by the <code>root</code> user.

== Configuring Virtualization Host SSH ==

'''Summary'''

The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager accesses virtualization hosts via SSH. To do this it logs in as the <code>root</code> user using an encrypted key for authentication. You must follow this procedure to ensure that SSH is configured to allow this.

'''Warning'''

The first time the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is connected to the host it will install an authentication key. In the process it will overwrite any existing keys contained in the <code>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file.

⁠

'''Procedure 7.4. Configuring virtualization host SSH'''

All commands in this procedure must be run as the <code>root</code> user.

<ol>
<li><p>'''Install the SSH server (openssh-server)'''</p>
<p>Install the openssh-server package using <code>yum</code>.</p>
<pre class="screen"># yum install openssh-server</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Edit SSH server configuration'''</p>
<p>Open the SSH server configuration, <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, in a text editor. Search for the ''<code>PermitRootLogin</code>''.</p>
<ul>
<li>If ''<code>PermitRootLogin</code>'' is set to <code>yes</code>, or is not set at all, no further action is required.</li>
<li>If ''<code>PermitRootLogin</code>'' is set to <code>no</code>, then you must change it to <code>yes</code>.</li></ul>

<p>Save any changes that you have made to the file, and exit the text editor.</p></li>
<li><p>'''Enable the SSH server'''</p>
<p>Configure the SSH server to start at system boot using the <code>chkconfig</code> command.</p>
<pre class="screen"># chkconfig --level 345 sshd on</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Start the SSH server'''</p>
<p>Start the SSH, or restart it if it is already running, using the <code>service</code> command.</p>
<pre class="screen"># service sshd restart</pre></li></ol>

'''Result'''

You have configured the virtualization host to allow <code>root</code> access over SSH.

== Adding a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Host ==

'''Summary'''

A Red Hat Enterprise Linux host is based on a standard &quot;basic&quot; installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The physical host must be set up before you can add it to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment.

The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager logs into the host to perform virtualization capability checks, install packages, create a network bridge, and reboot the host. The process of adding a new host can take up to 10 minutes.

⁠

'''Procedure 7.5. Adding a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Host'''

# Click the '''Hosts''' resource tab to list the hosts in the results list.
# Click '''New''' to open the '''New Host''' window.
# Use the drop-down menus to select the '''Data Center''' and '''Host Cluster''' for the new host.
# Enter the '''Name''', '''Address''', and '''SSH Port''' of the new host.
# Select an authentication method to use with the host.
#* Enter the root user's password to use password authentication.
#* Copy the key displayed in the '''SSH PublicKey''' field to <code>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> on the host to use public key authentication.
# You have now completed the mandatory steps to add a Red Hat Enterprise Linux host. Click the '''Advanced Parameters''' button to expand the advanced host settings.
## Optionally disable automatic firewall configuration.
## Optionally add a host SSH fingerprint to increase security. You can add it manually, or fetch it automatically.
# You can configure the '''Power Management''' and '''SPM''' using the applicable tabs now; however, as these are not fundamental to adding a Red Hat Enterprise Linux host, they are not covered in this procedure.
# Click '''OK''' to add the host and close the window.

'''Result'''

The new host displays in the list of hosts with a status of <code>Installing</code>. When installation is complete, the status updates to <code>Reboot</code>. The host must be activated for the status to change to <code>Up</code>.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' You can view the progress of the installation in the details pane.</div>

== Workflow Progress - Planning Your Data Center ==

== Planning Your Data Center ==

Successful planning is essential for a highly available, scalable Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment.

Although it is assumed that your solution architect has defined the environment before installation, the following considerations must be made when designing the system.

CPU

Virtual Machines must be distributed across hosts so that enough capacity is available to handle higher than average loads during peak processing. Average target utilization will be 50% of available CPU.

Memory

The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization page sharing process overcommits up to 150% of physical memory for virtual machines. Therefore, allow for an approximately 30% overcommit.

Networking

When designing the network, it is important to ensure that the volume of traffic produced by storage, remote connections and virtual machines is taken into account. As a general rule, allow approximately 50 MBps per virtual machine.

It is best practice to separate disk I/O traffic from end-user traffic, as this reduces the load on the Ethernet connection and reduces security vulnerabilities by isolating data from the visual stream. For Ethernet networks, it is suggested that bonds (802.3ad) are utilized to aggregate server traffic types.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' It is possible to connect both the storage and Hypervisors via a single high performance switch. For this configuration to be effective, the switch must be able to provide 30 GBps on the backplane.</div>

High Availability

The system requires at least two hosts to achieve high availability. This redundancy is useful when performing maintenance or repairs.

== Data Centers in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization ==

The data center is the highest level container for all physical and logical resources within a managed virtual environment. The data center is a collection of clusters of hosts. It owns the logical network (that is, the defined subnets for management, guest network traffic, and storage network traffic) and the storage pool.

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization contains a <code>Default</code> data center at installation. You can create new data centers that will also be managed from the single Administration Portal. For example, you may choose to have different data centers for different physical locations, business units, or for reasons of security. It is recommended that you do not remove the <code>Default</code> data center; instead, set up new appropriately named data centers.

The system administrator, as the superuser, can manage all aspects of the platform, that is, data centers, storage domains, users, roles, and permissions, by default; however, more specific administrative roles and permissions can be assigned to other users. For example, the enterprise may need a Data Center administrator for a specific data center, or a particular cluster may need an administrator. All system administration roles for physical resources have a hierarchical permission system. For example, a data center administrator will automatically have permission to manage all the objects in that data center - including storage domains, clusters, and hosts.

== Creating a New Data Center ==

'''Summary'''

This procedure creates a data center in your virtualization environment. The data center requires a functioning cluster, host, and storage domain to operate.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' The storage '''Type''' can be edited until the first storage domain is added to the data center. Once a storage domain has been added, the storage '''Type''' cannot be changed.

If you set the '''Compatibility Version''' as '''3.1''', it cannot be changed to '''3.0''' at a later time; version regression is not allowed.</div>

⁠

'''Procedure 8.1. Creating a New Data Center'''

# Select the '''Data Centers''' resource tab to list all data centers in the results list.
# Click '''New''' to open the '''New Data Center''' window.
# Enter the '''Name''' and '''Description''' of the data center.
# Select the storage '''Type''', '''Compatibility Version''', and '''Quota Mode''' of the data center from the drop-down menus.
# Click '''OK''' to create the data center and open the '''New Data Center - Guide Me''' window.
# The '''Guide Me''' window lists the entities that need to be configured for the data center. Configure these entities or postpone configuration by clicking the '''Configure Later''' button; configuration can be resumed by selecting the data center and clicking the '''Guide Me''' button.

'''Result'''

The new data center is added to the virtualization environment. It will remain '''Uninitialized''' until a cluster, host, and storage domain are configured for it; use '''Guide Me''' to configure these entities.

== Changing the Data Center Compatibility Version ==

'''Summary'''

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization data centers have a compatibility version. The compatibility version indicates the version of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization that the data center is intended to be compatible with. All clusters in the data center must support the desired compatibility level.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' To change the data center compatibility version, you must have first updated all the clusters in your data center to a level that supports your desired compatibility level.</div>

⁠

'''Procedure 8.2. Changing the Data Center Compatibility Version'''

# Log in to the Administration Portal as the administrative user. By default this is the <code>admin</code> user.
# Click the '''Data Centers''' tab.
# Select the data center to change from the list displayed. If the list of data centers is too long to filter visually then perform a search to locate the desired data center.
# Click the '''Edit''' button.
# Change the '''Compatibility Version''' to the desired value.
# Click '''OK'''.

'''Result'''

You have updated the compatibility version of the data center.

'''Warning'''

Upgrading the compatibility will also upgrade all of the storage domains belonging to the data center. If you are upgrading the compatibility version from below 3.1 to a higher version, these storage domains will become unusable with versions older than 3.1.

= ⁠Chapter 9. Configuring Clusters =

== Clusters in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization ==

A cluster is a collection of physical hosts that share similar characteristics and work together to provide computing resources in a highly available manner. In Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization the cluster must contain physical hosts that share the same storage domains and have the same type of CPU. Because virtual machines can be migrated across hosts in the same cluster, the cluster is the highest level at which power and load-sharing policies can be defined. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization platform contains a <code>Default</code> cluster in the <code>Default</code> data center at installation time.

Every cluster in the system must belong to a data center, and every host in the system must belong to a cluster. This enables the system to dynamically allocate a virtual machine to any host in the cluster, according to policies defined on the '''Cluster''' tab, thus maximizing memory and disk space, as well as virtual machine uptime.

At any given time, after a virtual machine runs on a specific host in the cluster, the virtual machine can be migrated to another host in the cluster using '''Migrate'''. This can be very useful when a host must be shut down for maintenance. The migration to another host in the cluster is transparent to the user, and the user continues working as usual. Note that a virtual machine cannot be migrated to a host outside the cluster.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.1 supports the use of clusters to manage Gluster storage bricks, in addition to virtualization hosts. To begin managing Gluster storage bricks, create a cluster with the '''Enable Gluster Service''' option selected. For further information on Gluster storage bricks, see the ''Red Hat Storage Administration Guide'', available at [https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Storage/ https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Storage/].</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization supports '''Memory Optimization''' by enabling and tuning Kernel Same-page Merging (KSM) on the virtualization hosts in the cluster. For more information on KSM, see the ''Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Virtualization Administration Guide''.</div>

== Creating a New Cluster ==

'''Summary'''

A data center can contain multiple clusters, and a cluster can contain multiple hosts. All hosts in a cluster must be of the same CPU type (Intel or AMD). It is recommended that you create your hosts before you create your cluster to ensure CPU type optimization. However, you can configure the hosts at a later time using the '''Guide Me''' button.

⁠

'''Procedure 9.1. Creating a New Cluster'''

# Select the '''Clusters''' resource tab.
# Click '''New''' to open the '''New Cluster''' window.
# Select the '''Data Center''' the cluster will belong to from the drop-down list.
# Enter the '''Name''' and '''Description''' of the cluster.
# Select the '''CPU Name''' and '''Compatibility Version''' from the drop-down lists. It is important to match the CPU processor family with the minimum CPU processor type of the hosts you intend to attach to the cluster, otherwise the host will be non-operational.
# Select either the '''Enable Virt Service''' or '''Enable Gluster Service''' radio button to define whether the cluster will be populated with virtual machine hosts or with Gluster-enabled nodes. Note that you cannot add Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor hosts to a Gluster-enabled cluster.
# Click the '''Optimization''' tab to select the memory page sharing threshold for the cluster, and optionally enable CPU thread handling and memory ballooning on the hosts in the cluster.
# Click the '''Cluster Policy''' tab to optionally configure a cluster policy, scheduler optimization settings, enable trusted service for hosts in the cluster, and enable HA Reservation.
# Click the '''Resilience Policy''' tab to select the virtual machine migration policy.
# Click the '''Console''' tab to optionally override the global SPICE proxy, if any, and specify the address of a SPICE proxy for hosts in the cluster.
# Click '''OK''' to create the cluster and open the '''New Cluster - Guide Me''' window.
# The '''Guide Me''' window lists the entities that need to be configured for the cluster. Configure these entities or postpone configuration by clicking the '''Configure Later''' button; configuration can be resumed by selecting the cluster and clicking the '''Guide Me''' button.

'''Result'''

The new cluster is added to the virtualization environment.

== Changing the Cluster Compatibility Version ==

'''Summary'''

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization clusters have a compatibility version. The cluster compatibility version indicates the features of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization supported by all of the hosts in the cluster. The cluster compatibility is set according to the version of the least capable host operating system in the cluster.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' To change the cluster compatibility version, you must have first updated all the hosts in your cluster to a level that supports your desired compatibility level.</div>

⁠

'''Procedure 9.2. Changing the Cluster Compatibility Version'''

# Log in to the Administration Portal as the administrative user. By default this is the <code>admin</code> user.
# Click the '''Clusters''' tab.
# Select the cluster to change from the list displayed. If the list of clusters is too long to filter visually then perform a search to locate the desired cluster.
# Click the '''Edit''' button.
# Change the '''Compatibility Version''' to the desired value.
# Click '''OK''' to open the '''Change Cluster Compatibility Version''' confirmation window.
# Click '''OK''' to confirm.

'''Result'''

You have updated the compatibility version of the cluster. Once you have updated the compatibility version of all clusters in a data center, then you are also able to change the compatibility version of the data center itself.

'''Warning'''

Upgrading the compatibility will also upgrade all of the storage domains belonging to the data center. If you are upgrading the compatibility version from below 3.1 to a higher version, these storage domains will become unusable with versions older than 3.1.

= ⁠Chapter 10. Configuring Networking =

== ⁠10.1. Workflow Progress - Network Setup ==

[[Image:images/1195.png]]

== ⁠10.2. Networking in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization ==

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization uses networking to support almost every aspect of operations. Storage, host management, user connections, and virtual machine connectivity, for example, all rely on a well planned and configured network to deliver optimal performance. Setting up networking is a vital prerequisite for a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment because it is much simpler to plan for your projected networking requirements and implement your network accordingly than it is to discover your networking requirements through use and attempt to alter your network configuration retroactively.

It is however possible to deploy a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment with no consideration given to networking at all. Simply ensuring that each physical machine in the environment has at least one ''Network Interface Controller'' (NIC) is enough to begin using Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization. While it is true that this approach to networking will provide a functional environment, it will not provide an optimal environment. As network usage varies by task or action, grouping related tasks or functions into specialized networks can improve performance while simplifying the troubleshooting of network issues.

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization separates network traffic by defining logical networks. Logical networks define the path that a selected network traffic type must take through the network. They are created to isolate network traffic by functionality or virtualize a physical topology.

The <code>rhevm</code> logical network is created by default and labeled as the '''Management'''. The <code>rhevm</code> logical network is intended for management traffic between the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager and virtualization hosts. You are able to define additional logical networks to segregate:

* Display related network traffic.
* General virtual machine network traffic.
* Storage related network traffic.

For optimal performance it is recommended that these traffic types be separated using logical networks. Logical networks may be supported using physical devices such as NICs or logical devices, such as network bonds. It is not necessary to have one device for each logical network as multiple logical networks are able to share a single device. This is accomplished using Virtual LAN (VLAN) tagging to isolate network traffic. To make use of this facility VLAN tagging must also be supported at the switch level.

The limits that apply to the number of logical networks that you may define in a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment are:

* The number of logical networks attached to a host is limited to the number of available network devices combined with the maximum number of Virtual LANs (VLANs) which is 4096.
* The number of logical networks in a cluster is limited to the number of logical networks that can be attached to a host as networking must be the same for all hosts in a cluster.
* The number of logical networks in a data center is limited only by the number of clusters it contains in combination with the number of logical networks permitted per cluster.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' From Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.3, network traffic for migrating virtual machines has been separated from network traffic for communication between the Manager and hosts. This prevents hosts from becoming non-responsive when importing or migrating virtual machines.</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' A familiarity with the network concepts and their use is highly recommended when planning and setting up networking in a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. This document does not describe the concepts, protocols, requirements or general usage of networking. It is recommended that you read your network hardware vendor's guides for more information on managing networking.</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Important:''' Additional care must be taken when modifying the properties of the <code>rhevm</code> network. Incorrect changes to the properties of the <code>rhevm</code> network may cause hosts to become temporarily unreachable.</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Important:''' If you plan to use Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization nodes to provide any services, remember that the services will stop if the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment stops operating.</div>

This applies to all services, but you should be fully aware of the hazards of running the following on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization:

* Directory Services
* DNS
* Storage

= ⁠Chapter 11. Configuring Storage =

== ⁠11.1. Workflow Progress - Storage Setup ==

[[Image:images/1197.png]]

== ⁠11.2. Introduction to Storage in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization ==

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization uses a centralized storage system for virtual machine disk images, ISO files and snapshots. Storage networking can be implemented using:

* Network File System (NFS)
* GlusterFS exports
* Other POSIX compliant file systems
* Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI)
* Local storage attached directly to the virtualization hosts
* Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP)
* Parallel NFS (pNFS)

Setting up storage is a prerequisite for a new data center because a data center cannot be initialized unless storage domains are attached and activated.

As a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization system administrator, you need to create, configure, attach and maintain storage for the virtualized enterprise. You should be familiar with the storage types and their use. Read your storage array vendor's guides, and refer to the ''Red Hat Enterprise Linux Storage Administration Guide'' for more information on the concepts, protocols, requirements or general usage of storage.

The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization platform enables you to assign and manage storage using the Administration Portal's '''Storage''' tab. The '''Storage''' results list displays all the storage domains, and the details pane shows general information about the domain.

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization platform has three types of storage domains:

<ul>
<li>'''Data Domain:''' A data domain holds the virtual hard disks and OVF files of all the virtual machines and templates in a data center. In addition, snapshots of the virtual machines are also stored in the data domain.
The data domain cannot be shared across data centers. Storage domains of multiple types (iSCSI, NFS, FC, POSIX, and Gluster) can be added to the same data center, provided they are all shared, rather than local, domains.
You must attach a data domain to a data center before you can attach domains of other types to it.</li>
<li>'''ISO Domain:''' ISO domains store ISO files (or logical CDs) used to install and boot operating systems and applications for the virtual machines. An ISO domain removes the data center's need for physical media. An ISO domain can be shared across different data centers.</li>
<li><p>'''Export Domain:''' Export domains are temporary storage repositories that are used to copy and move images between data centers and Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environments. Export domains can be used to backup virtual machines. An export domain can be moved between data centers, however, it can only be active in one data center at a time.</p>
<p>'''Important'''</p>
<p>Support for export storage domains backed by storage on anything other than NFS is being deprecated. While existing export storage domains imported from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2.2 environments remain supported new export storage domains must be created on NFS storage.</p></li></ul>

Only commence configuring and attaching storage for your Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment once you have determined the storage needs of your data center(s).

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Important:''' To add storage domains you must be able to successfully access the Administration Portal, and there must be at least one host connected with a status of '''Up'''.</div>

== ⁠11.3. Preparing NFS Storage ==

'''Summary'''

These steps must be taken to prepare an NFS file share on a server running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 for use with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization.

⁠

'''Procedure 11.1. Preparing NFS Storage'''

<ol>
<li><p>'''Install nfs-utils'''</p>
<p>NFS functionality is provided by the nfs-utils package. Before file shares can be created, check that the package is installed by querying the RPM database for the system:</p>
<pre class="screen">$ rpm -qi nfs-utils</pre>
<p>If the nfs-utils package is installed then the package information will be displayed. If no output is displayed then the package is not currently installed. Install it using <code>yum</code> while logged in as the <code>root</code> user:</p>
<pre class="screen"># yum install nfs-utils</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Configure Boot Scripts'''</p>
<p>To ensure that NFS shares are always available when the system is operational both the <code>nfs</code> and <code>rpcbind</code> services must start at boot time. Use the <code>chkconfig</code> command while logged in as <code>root</code> to modify the boot scripts.</p>
<pre class="screen"># chkconfig --add rpcbind
# chkconfig --add nfs
# chkconfig rpcbind on
# chkconfig nfs on</pre>
<p>Once the boot script configuration has been done, start the services for the first time.</p>
<pre class="screen"># service rpcbind start
# service nfs start</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Create Directory'''</p>
<p>Create the directory you wish to share using NFS.</p>
<pre class="screen"># mkdir /exports/iso</pre>
<p>Replace ''/exports/iso'' with the name, and path of the directory you wish to use.</p></li>
<li><p>'''Export Directory'''</p>
<p>To be accessible over the network using NFS the directory must be exported. NFS exports are controlled using the <code>/etc/exports</code> configuration file. Each export path appears on a separate line followed by a tab character and any additional NFS options. Exports to be attached to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager must have the read, and write, options set.</p>
<p>To grant read, and write access to <code>/exports/iso</code> using NFS for example you add the following line to the <code>/etc/exports</code> file.</p>
<pre class="screen">/exports/iso       *(rw)</pre>
<p>Again, replace ''/exports/iso'' with the name, and path of the directory you wish to use.</p></li>
<li><p>'''Reload NFS Configuration'''</p>
<p>For the changes to the <code>/etc/exports</code> file to take effect the service must be told to reload the configuration. To force the service to reload the configuration run the following command as <code>root</code>:</p>
<pre class="screen"># service nfs reload</pre></li>
<li><p>'''Set Permissions'''</p>
<p>The NFS export directory must be configured for read write access and must be owned by vdsm:kvm. If these users do not exist on your external NFS server use the following command, assuming that <code>/exports/iso</code> is the directory to be used as an NFS share.</p>
<pre class="screen"># chown -R 36:36 /exports/iso</pre>
<p>The permissions on the directory must be set to allow read and write access to the owner, and read and execute access to the group and other users. The owner will also have execute access to the directory. The permissions are set using the <code>chmod</code> command. The following command arguments set the required permissions on the <code>/exports/iso</code> directory.</p>
<pre class="screen"># chmod 0755 /exports/iso</pre></li></ol>

'''Result'''

The NFS file share has been created, and is ready to be attached by the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

== ⁠11.4. Attaching NFS Storage ==

'''Summary'''

An NFS type '''Storage Domain''' is a mounted NFS share that is attached to a data center. It is used to provide storage for virtualized guest images and ISO boot media. Once NFS storage has been exported it must be attached to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager using the Administration Portal.

NFS data domains can be added to NFS data centers. You can add NFS, ISO, and export storage domains to data centers of any type.

⁠

'''Procedure 11.2. Attaching NFS Storage'''

<ol>
<li>Click the '''Storage''' resource tab to list the existing storage domains.</li>
<li><p>Click '''New Domain''' to open the '''New Domain''' window.</p>
<p>⁠</p>
<p>[[Image:images/1097.png|NFS Storage]]</p>
<p>'''Figure 11.1. NFS Storage'''</p></li>
<li>Enter the '''Name''' of the storage domain.</li>
<li>Select the '''Data Center''', '''Domain Function / Storage Type''', and '''Use Host''' from the drop-down menus.
If applicable, select the '''Format''' from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Enter the '''Export Path''' to be used for the storage domain.
The export path should be in the format of <code>192.168.0.10:/data or domain.example.com:/data</code></li>
<li><p>Click '''Advanced Parameters''' to enable further configurable settings. It is recommended that the values of these parameters not be modified.</p>
<p>'''Important'''</p>
<p>All communication to the storage domain is from the selected host and not directly from the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager. At least one active host must be attached to the chosen Data Center before the storage is configured.</p></li>
<li>Click '''OK''' to create the storage domain and close the window.</li></ol>

'''Result'''

The new NFS data domain is displayed on the '''Storage''' tab with a status of <code>Locked</code> while the disk prepares. It is automatically attached to the data center upon completion.

== ⁠11.5. Adding iSCSI Storage ==

'''Summary'''

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization platform supports iSCSI storage by creating a storage domain from a volume group made of pre-existing LUNs. Neither volume groups nor LUNs can be attached to more than one storage domain at a time.

For information regarding the setup and configuration of iSCSI on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, see the ''Red Hat Enterprise Linux Storage Administration Guide''.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' You can only add an iSCSI storage domain to a data center that is set up for iSCSI storage type.</div>

⁠

'''Procedure 11.3. Adding iSCSI Storage'''

<ol>
<li>Click the '''Storage''' resource tab to list the existing storage domains in the results list.</li>
<li>Click the '''New Domain''' button to open the '''New Domain''' window.</li>
<li><p>Enter the '''Name''' of the new storage domain.</p>
<p>⁠</p>
<p>[[Image:images/5590.png|New iSCSI Domain]]</p>
<p>'''Figure 11.2. New iSCSI Domain'''</p></li>
<li>Use the '''Data Center''' drop-down menu to select an iSCSI data center.
If you do not yet have an appropriate iSCSI data center, select <code>(none)</code>.</li>
<li>Use the drop-down menus to select the '''Domain Function / Storage Type''' and the '''Format'''. The storage domain types that are not compatible with the chosen data center are not available.</li>
<li><p>Select an active host in the '''Use Host''' field. If this is not the first data domain in a data center, you must select the data center's SPM host.</p>
<p>'''Important'''</p>
<p>All communication to the storage domain is via the selected host and not directly from the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager. At least one active host must exist in the system, and be attached to the chosen data center, before the storage is configured.</p></li>
<li><p>The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is able to map either iSCSI targets to LUNs, or LUNs to iSCSI targets. The '''New Domain''' window automatically displays known targets with unused LUNs when iSCSI is selected as the storage type. If the target that you are adding storage from is not listed then you can use target discovery to find it, otherwise proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>'''iSCSI Target Discovery'''</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click '''Discover Targets''' to enable target discovery options. When targets have been discovered and logged in to, the '''New Domain''' window automatically displays targets with LUNs unused by the environment.</p>
<p>'''Note'''</p>
<p>LUNs used externally to the environment are also displayed.</p>
<p>You can use the '''Discover Targets''' options to add LUNs on many targets, or multiple paths to the same LUNs.</p></li>
<li>Enter the fully qualified domain name or IP address of the iSCSI host in the '''Address''' field.</li>
<li>Enter the port to connect to the host on when browsing for targets in the '''Port''' field. The default is <code>3260</code>.</li>
<li>If the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is being used to secure the storage, select the '''User Authentication''' check box. Enter the '''CHAP user name''' and '''CHAP password'''.</li>
<li>Click the '''Discover''' button.</li>
<li>Select the target to use from the discovery results and click the '''Login''' button.
Alternatively, click the '''Login All''' to log in to all of the discovered targets.</li></ol>
</li>
<li>Click the '''+''' button next to the desired target. This will expand the entry and display all unused LUNs attached to the target.</li>
<li>Select the check box for each LUN that you are using to create the storage domain.</li>
<li>Click '''OK''' to create the storage domain and close the window.</li></ol>

'''Result'''

The new iSCSI storage domain displays on the storage tab. This can take up to 5 minutes.

== ⁠11.6. Adding FCP Storage ==

'''Summary'''

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization platform supports SAN storage by creating a storage domain from a volume group made of pre-existing LUNs. Neither volume groups nor LUNs can be attached to more than one storage domain at a time.

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization system administrators need a working knowledge of Storage Area Networks (SAN) concepts. SAN usually uses Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) for traffic between hosts and shared external storage. For this reason, SAN may occasionally be referred to as FCP storage.

For information regarding the setup and configuration of FCP or multipathing on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, please refer to the ''Storage Administration Guide'' and ''DM Multipath Guide''.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Note:''' You can only add an FCP storage domain to a data center that is set up for FCP storage type.</div>

⁠

'''Procedure 11.4. Adding FCP Storage'''

<ol>
<li>Click the '''Storage''' resource tab to list all storage domains in the virtualized environment.</li>
<li>Click '''New Domain''' to open the '''New Domain''' window.</li>
<li><p>Enter the '''Name''' of the storage domain</p>
<p>⁠</p>
<p>[[Image:images/5591.png|Adding FCP Storage]]</p>
<p>'''Figure 11.3. Adding FCP Storage'''</p></li>
<li>Use the '''Data Center''' drop-down menu to select an FCP data center.
If you do not yet have an appropriate FCP data center, select <code>(none)</code>.</li>
<li>Use the drop-down menus to select the '''Domain Function / Storage Type''' and the '''Format'''. The storage domain types that are not compatible with the chosen data center are not available.</li>
<li><p>Select an active host in the '''Use Host''' field. If this is not the first data domain in a data center, you must select the data center's SPM host.</p>
<p>'''Important'''</p>
<p>All communication to the storage domain is via the selected host and not directly from the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager. At least one active host must exist in the system, and be attached to the chosen data center, before the storage is configured.</p></li>
<li>The '''New Domain''' window automatically displays known targets with unused LUNs when '''Data / Fibre Channel''' is selected as the storage type. Select the '''LUN ID''' check box to select all of the available LUNs.</li>
<li>Click '''OK''' to create the storage domain and close the window.</li></ol>

'''Result'''

The new FCP data domain displays on the '''Storage''' tab. It will remain with a <code>Locked</code> status while it is being prepared for use. When ready, it is automatically attached to the data center.

== ⁠11.7. Preparing Local Storage ==

'''Summary'''

A local storage domain can be set up on a host. When you set up host to use local storage, the host automatically gets added to a new data center and cluster that no other hosts can be added to. Multiple host clusters require that all hosts have access to all storage domains, which is not possible with local storage. Virtual machines created in a single host cluster cannot be migrated, fenced or scheduled.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Important:''' On Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisors the only path permitted for use as local storage is <code>/data/images</code>. This directory already exists with the correct permissions on Hypervisor installations. The steps in this procedure are only required when preparing local storage on Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtualization hosts.</div>

⁠

'''Procedure 11.5. Preparing Local Storage'''

<ol>
<li><p>On the virtualization host, create the directory to be used for the local storage.</p>
<pre class="screen"># mkdir -p /data/images</pre></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the directory has permissions allowing read/write access to the <code>vdsm</code> user (UID 36) and <code>kvm</code> group (GID 36).</p>
<pre class="screen"># chown 36:36 /data /data/images</pre>
<pre class="screen"># chmod 0755 /data /data/images</pre></li></ol>

'''Result'''

Your local storage is ready to be added to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment.

== ⁠11.8. Adding Local Storage ==

'''Summary'''

Storage local to your host has been prepared. Now use the Manager to add it to the host.

Adding local storage to a host in this manner causes the host to be put in a new data center and cluster. The local storage configuration window combines the creation of a data center, a cluster, and storage into a single process.

⁠

'''Procedure 11.6. Adding Local Storage'''

<ol>
<li>Use the '''Hosts''' resource tab, tree mode, or the search function to find and select the host in the results list.</li>
<li>Click '''Maintenance''' to open the '''Maintenance Host(s)''' confirmation window.</li>
<li>Click '''OK''' to initiate maintenance mode.</li>
<li><p>Click '''Configure Local Storage''' to open the '''Configure Local Storage''' window.</p>
<p>⁠</p>
<p>[[Image:images/5592.png|Configure Local Storage Window]]</p>
<p>'''Figure 11.4. Configure Local Storage Window'''</p></li>
<li>Click the '''Edit''' buttons next to the '''Data Center''', '''Cluster''', and '''Storage''' fields to configure and name the local storage domain.</li>
<li>Set the path to your local storage in the text entry field.</li>
<li>If applicable, select the '''Optimization''' tab to configure the memory optimization policy for the new local storage cluster.</li>
<li>Click '''OK''' to save the settings and close the window.</li></ol>

'''Result'''

Your host comes online in a data center of its own.

== ⁠11.9. POSIX Compliant File System Storage in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization ==

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.1 and higher supports the use of POSIX (native) file systems for storage. POSIX file system support allows you to mount file systems using the same mount options that you would normally use when mounting them manually from the command line. This functionality is intended to allow access to storage not exposed using NFS, iSCSI, or FCP.

Any POSIX compliant filesystem used as a storage domain in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization '''MUST''' support sparse files and direct I/O. The Common Internet File System (CIFS), for example, does not support direct I/O, making it incompatible with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization.

<div class="alert alert-info">'''Important:''' Do ''not'' mount NFS storage by creating a POSIX compliant file system Storage Domain. Always create an NFS Storage Domain instead.</div>

== ⁠11.10. Attaching POSIX Compliant File System Storage ==

'''Summary'''

You want to use a POSIX compliant file system that is not exposed using NFS, iSCSI, or FCP as a storage domain.

⁠

'''Procedure 11.7. Attaching POSIX Compliant File System Storage'''

<ol>
<li>Click the '''Storage''' resource tab to list the existing storage domains in the results list.</li>
<li><p>Click '''New Domain''' to open the '''New Domain''' window.</p>
<p>⁠</p>
<p>[[Image:images/5597.png|POSIX Storage]]</p>
<p>'''Figure 11.5. POSIX Storage'''</p></li>
<li>Enter the '''Name''' for the storage domain.</li>
<li>Select the '''Data Center''' to be associated with the storage domain. The Data Center selected must be of type '''POSIX (POSIX compliant FS)'''. Alternatively, select <code>(none)</code>.</li>
<li>Select <code>Data / POSIX compliant FS</code> from the '''Domain Function / Storage Type''' drop-down menu.
If applicable, select the '''Format''' from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Select a host from the '''Use Host''' drop-down menu. Only hosts within the selected data center will be listed. The host that you select will be used to connect the storage domain.</li>
<li>Enter the '''Path''' to the POSIX file system, as you would normally provide it to the <code>mount</code> command.</li>
<li>Enter the '''VFS Type''', as you would normally provide it to the <code>mount</code> command using the ''<code>-t</code>'' argument. See <code>man mount</code> for a list of valid VFS types.</li>
<li>Enter additional '''Mount Options''', as you would normally provide them to the <code>mount</code> command using the ''<code>-o</code>'' argument. The mount options should be provided in a comma-separated list. See <code>man mount</code> for a list of valid mount options.</li>
<li>Click '''OK''' to attach the new Storage Domain and close the window.</li></ol>

'''Result'''

You have used a supported mechanism to attach an unsupported file system as a storage domain.

== ⁠11.11. Enabling Gluster Processes on Red Hat Storage Nodes ==

'''Summary'''

This procedure explains how to allow Gluster processes on Red Hat Storage Nodes.

<ol>
<li>In the Navigation Pane, select the '''Clusters''' tab.</li>
<li>Select '''New'''.</li>
<li><p>Select the &quot;Enable Gluster Service&quot; radio button. Provide the address, SSH fingerprint, and password as necessary. The address and password fields can be filled in only when the '''Import existing Gluster configuration''' check box is selected.</p>
<p>⁠</p>
<p>[[Image:images/4539.png|Description]]</p>
<p>'''Figure 11.6. Selecting the &quot;Enable Gluster Service&quot; Radio Button'''</p></li>
<li>Click '''OK'''.</li></ol>

'''Result'''

It is now possible to add Red Hat Storage nodes to the Gluster cluster, and to mount Gluster volumes as storage domains. '''iptables''' rules no longer block storage domains from being added to the cluster.

== ⁠11.12. Populating the ISO Storage Domain ==

'''Summary'''

An ISO storage domain is attached to a data center, ISO images must be uploaded to it. Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization provides an ISO uploader tool that ensures that the images are uploaded into the correct directory path, with the correct user permissions.

The creation of ISO images from physical media is not described in this document. It is assumed that you have access to the images required for your environment.

⁠

'''Procedure 11.8. Populating the ISO Storage Domain'''

<ol>
<li>Copy the required ISO image to a temporary directory on the system running Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.</li>
<li>Log in to the system running Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager as the <code>root</code> user.</li>
<li><p>Use the <code>engine-iso-uploader</code> command to upload the ISO image. This action will take some time, the amount of time varies depending on the size of the image being uploaded and available network bandwidth.</p>
<p>⁠</p>
<p>'''Example 11.1. ISO Uploader Usage'''</p>
<p>In this example the ISO image <code>RHEL6.iso</code> is uploaded to the ISO domain called <code>ISODomain</code> using NFS. The command will prompt for an administrative user name and password. The user name must be provided in the form ''user name''@''domain''.</p>
<pre class="screen"># engine-iso-uploader --iso-domain=ISODomain upload RHEL6.iso</pre></li></ol>

'''Result'''

The ISO image is uploaded and appears in the ISO storage domain specified. It is also available in the list of available boot media when creating virtual machines in the data center which the storage domain is attached to.

== ⁠11.13. VirtIO and Guest Tool Image Files ==

The virtio-win ISO and Virtual Floppy Drive (VFD) images, which contain the VirtIO drivers for Windows virtual machines, and the rhev-tools-setup ISO, which contains the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Guest Tools for Windows virtual machines, are copied to an ISO storage domain upon installation and configuration of the domain.

These image files provide software that can be installed on virtual machines to improve performance and usability. The most recent virtio-win and rhev-tools-setup files can be accessed via the following symbolic links on the file system of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager:

* <code>/usr/share/virtio-win/virtio-win.iso</code>
* <code>/usr/share/virtio-win/virtio-win_x86.vfd</code>
* <code>/usr/share/virtio-win/virtio-win_amd64.vfd</code>
* <code>/usr/share/rhev-guest-tools-iso/rhev-tools-setup.iso</code>

These image files must be manually uploaded to ISO storage domains that were not created locally by the installation process. Use the <code>engine-iso-uploader</code> command to upload these images to your ISO storage domain. Once uploaded, the image files can be attached to and used by virtual machines.

== ⁠11.14. Uploading the VirtIO and Guest Tool Image Files to an ISO Storage Domain ==

The example below demonstrates the command to upload the <code>virtio-win.iso</code>, <code>virtio-win_x86.vfd</code>, <code>virtio-win_amd64.vfd</code>, and <code>rhev-tools-setup.iso</code> image files to the <code>ISODomain</code>.

⁠

'''Example 11.2. Uploading the VirtIO and Guest Tool Image Files'''

<pre class="screen"># engine-iso-uploader --iso-domain=[ISODomain] upload /usr/share/virtio-win/virtio-win.iso /usr/share/virtio-win/virtio-win_x86.vfd /usr/share/virtio-win/virtio-win_amd64.vfd /usr/share/rhev-guest-tools-iso/rhev-tools-setup.iso</pre>
