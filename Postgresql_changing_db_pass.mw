# # make a backup
# read PASSWD
# /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/encryptpasswd.sh $PASSWD
# unset PASSWD
# # copy the encrypted password and uptate the file ''/etc/sysconfig/ovirt-engine'' with the encrypted password
# update the clear-text password in the file ''/etc/ovirt-engine/.pgpass''
# su - postgres
# postgres=# alter user engine with password 'NEW_CLEAR_TEXT_PASS';
# postgres=# alter user postgres with password 'NEW_CLEAR_TEXT_PASS';
# service ovirt-engine restart

Everything should work as before.
