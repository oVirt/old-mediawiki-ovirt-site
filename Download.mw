= oVirt Deployment Options =
oVirt is a virtual datacenter manager that delivers powerful management of multiple virtual machines on multiple hosts. Using KVM and libvirt, oVirt can be installed on Fedora, CentOS, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts to set up and manage your virtual data center.

If you are absolutely new to oVirt, try our [[OVirt_Live | Live version]] where you can test-drive oVirt on CentOS without installing it on your machine.

If you have some knowledge of installing packages on Linux, you can install [[#Install_oVirt | oVirt]] directly on a host machine. 

Experienced users can also compile from source, using the guides for the [[Building oVirt engine |  oVirt engine]] and [[Node Building | oVirt Node]].

== GPG Keys used by oVirt ==
<div class="alert alert-info">
'''Important:''' We are going to sign RPMs only from next release. Please wait for the announcement email 
</div>

How does oVirt Project use GPG keys to sign packages?                 
Each stable RPM package that is published by oVirt  Project is signed with a GPG signature.  By default, yum and the  graphical update tools will verify these signatures and refuse to  install any packages that are not signed or have bad signatures.  You  should always verify the signature of a package before you install it. These signatures ensure that the packages you install are what was  produced by the oVirt Project and have not been altered (accidentally  or maliciously) by any mirror or website that is providing the packages. Nightly repositories wont be signed.

===Importing keys Manually===
For some repositories, such as repositories with stable in default configuration, yum  is able to find a proper key for the repository and asks the user for  confirmation before importing the key if the key is not already imported  into the rpm database.

To get the public key:
<kbd><pre>
$ gpg --recv-keys --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net FE590CB7
$ gpg --list-keys --with-fingerprint FE590CB7
---
pub   2048R/FE590CB7 2014-03-30 [expires: 2016-04-02]
      Key fingerprint = 31A5 D783 7FAD 7CB2 86CD  3469 AB8C 4F9D FE59 0CB7
uid                  oVirt <infra@ovirt.org>
sub   2048R/004BC303 2014-03-30
---
$ gpg --export --armor FE590CB7 > ovirt-infra.pub
# rpm --import ovirt-infra.pub
</pre></kbd>

Importing keys Automatically
<kbd><pre>
install ovirt-release
install ovirt package using yum
</pre></kbd>
<div class="alert alert-info">
'''Important:''' yum will prompt sysadmin to acknowedge import of key, make sure key id is FE590CB7.
</div>

===Verifying a package===
When using default configuration of yum  package updating and installation tool in stable releases, signature of  each package is verified before it is installed.  Signature  verification can be turned off and on globally or for specific  repository with gpgcheck directive.  Do not override the default setting of this directive unless you have a very good reason to do so.
If you do not use yum, you can check the signature of the package using the following command

<kbd><pre>
rpm {-K|--checksig} PACKAGE_FILE ...
</pre></kbd>

== Install oVirt ==

oVirt release 3.4 is intended for production use and is available for the following platforms:

<ul>
* oVirt for Fedora Core ([[#Fedora_Installation_Instructions |Guide]])
* oVirt for RHEL ([[#Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux 6/CentOS_Installation_Instructions |Guide]])
* oVirt for CentOS ([[#Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux 6/CentOS_Installation_Instructions |Guide]])
* oVirt for Scientific Linux
* oVirt for Gentoo ([//wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/OVirt Experimental])
* oVirt for Debian ([[ovirt build on debian/ubuntu |Guide]]) 
</ul>

Our recommended method of installing oVirt is to use the pre-built packages for Fedora or a supported EL6 distribution, such as CentOS or RHEL. This makes installing oVirt very easy. Naturally, you can run most Linux distributions or several other operating systems (e.g. Windows) as [[#Supported_Guest_Distributions | guests]] inside of oVirt instances.

 <div class="alert alert-info">
'''Important:''' If you're upgrading from a previous version, please update ovirt-release to the latest version (10) and verify you have the correct repositories enabled by running the following commands before upgrading with the usual procedure. 
     # yum update ovirt-release
     # yum repolist enabled
You should see the ovirt-3.4 and ovirt-stable repositories listed in the output of the repolist command.

<ol>
<li>Add the official oVirt repository for Fedora. <kbd><pre>sudo yum localinstall http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/ovirt-release.noarch.rpm</pre></kbd>
<ul>
<li> This will add repositories from ovirt.org to your host allowing you to get the latest and greatest oVirt rpms.
<li> It will also enable the [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Virtualization_Preview_Repository virt-preview] repository on your machine giving you access to the latest versions of things like libvirt and KVM.
</ul>
<li>Install oVirt Engine. <kbd><pre>sudo yum install -y ovirt-engine</pre></kbd>
<li>Optionally, install the All-In-One plugin if you want to host VMs on your Engine Host <kbd><pre>sudo yum install -y ovirt-engine-setup-plugin-allinone</pre></kbd>
<li>Set up oVirt Engine. <kbd><pre>sudo engine-setup</pre></kbd>
<li> Follow the on screen prompts to configure and install the engine
<li>Once you have successfully installed oVirt Engine, you will be provided with instructions to access oVirt's web-based management interface.
<li>Congratulations! oVirt Engine is now installed!
<li>For every virtualization server you'd like to manage, you can now [[Quick Start Guide#Install_Hosts | set them up as oVirt hosts]] .
