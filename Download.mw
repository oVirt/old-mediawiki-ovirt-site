We’re working hard to make oVirt easy to install and available everywhere.

Since oVirt is a relatively young project, setting it up is still a little tricky… but it’s getting easier with every release. 

Right now, oVirt runs best on Fedora or CentOS/RHEL — and we tailored our quickstart guide to reflect this fact — but if you’re not afraid of compiling from source, we also have guides on how to install [[Building oVirt engine | the oVirt engine]] and [[Node Building | oVirt Node]] from source.

You can also [[porting oVirt | help us make oVirt easier to install everywhere]] too.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you're upgrading from a previous version, please update
ovirt-release to the latest version (10) and verify you have the correct
repositories enabled by running the following commands

<pre># yum update ovirt-release
# yum repolist enabled
</pre>
before upgrading with the usual procedure. You should see the ovirt-3.3.2 and
ovirt-stable repositories listed in the output of the repolist command.
</div>

Our recommended method of installing oVirt is to use the pre-built packages for Fedora or an EL6 distribution. It makes installing oVirt very easy. Naturally, you can run any Linux distribution or several other operating systems (e.g. Windows) as guests inside of oVirt instances.

If you are looking to preview the project without permanently dedicating a machine, you can also try the LiveCD image.  This image will appear under the [http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/stable/tools tools] directory.  This generally appears a week or two after a release, due to the need to have final release packages available.

<li> This will add repositories from ovirt.org to your host allowing you to get the latest and greatest oVirt rpms.
<li> It will also enable the [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Virtualization_Preview_Repository virt-preview] repository on your machine giving you access to the latest versions of things like libvirt and KVM.

These instructions should work for both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS.  They will likely work with other binary compatible EL6 version as well, but they were not tested.  It is strongly recommended that you use at least version 6.4.
