We’re working hard to make oVirt easy to install and available everywhere.

Since oVirt is a relatively young project, setting it up is still a little tricky… but it’s getting easier with every release. 

Right now, oVirt runs best on Fedora — and we tailored our quickstart guide to reflect this fact — but if you’re not afraid of compiling from source, we also have guides on [[how to install oVirt for many distributions]].

You can also [[help us make oVirt easier to install everywhere]] too.

Our recommended method of installing oVirt is to use the pre-built packages for Fedora. It makes installing oVirt very easy. Naturally, you can run any Linux distribution or several other operating systems (e.g. Windows) as guests inside of oVirt instances.

<!-- Normally, an <ol> isn't needed, but we're starting with 0 here, for fun. -->
<ol start="0" class="steps endian">
<li>Add the official oVirt repository for Fedora. <kbd><pre>sudo yum localinstall http://ovirt.org/releases/ovirt-release-fedora.noarch.rpm</pre></kbd>
<li>Install oVirt Engine. <kbd><pre>sudo yum install -y ovirt-engine</pre></kbd>
<li>Set up oVirt Engine. <kbd><pre>sudo engine-setup</pre></kbd>
<li>Once you have successfully installed oVirt Engine, you will be provided with instructions to access oVirt's web-based management interface.
<li>Congratulations! oVirt Engine is now installed!
<li>You can now [[download and install oVirt Node]] for every virtualization server you'd like to set up.
