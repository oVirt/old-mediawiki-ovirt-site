= oVirt Deployment Options =
oVirt is a virtual datacenter manager that delivers powerful management of multiple virtual machines on multiple hosts. Using KVM and libvirt, oVirt can be installed on Fedora, CentOS, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts to set up and manage your virtual data center.

If you are absolutely new to oVirt, try our [[OVirt_Live| Live version]] where you can test-drive oVirt on CentOS without installing it on your machine.

If you have some knowledge of installing packages on Linux, you should install our All-in-One solution using the [[#Quick_Start_Guide | Quick Start]] instructions below. 

Experienced users can also compile from source, using the guides on [[Building oVirt engine | the oVirt engine]] and [[Node Building | oVirt Node]].

== Quick Start Guide ==

<div class="alert alert-info">
IMPORTANT NOTE: If you're upgrading from a previous version, please update
ovirt-release to the latest version (10) and verify you have the correct
repositories enabled by running the following commands

<pre># yum update ovirt-release
# yum repolist enabled
</pre>
before upgrading with the usual procedure. You should see the ovirt-3.3.2 and
ovirt-stable repositories listed in the output of the repolist command.
</div>

Our recommended method of installing oVirt is to use the pre-built packages for Fedora or an EL6 distribution. It makes installing oVirt very easy. Naturally, you can run any Linux distribution or several other operating systems (e.g. Windows) as guests inside of oVirt instances.

If you are looking to preview the project without permanently dedicating a machine, you can also try the LiveCD image.  This image will appear under the [http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/stable/tools tools] directory.  This generally appears a week or two after a release, due to the need to have final release packages available.

<li>Add the official oVirt repository for Fedora. <kbd><pre>sudo yum localinstall http://ovirt.org/releases/ovirt-release-fedora.noarch.rpm</pre></kbd>
<ul>
<li> This will add repositories from ovirt.org to your host allowing you to get the latest and greatest oVirt rpms.
<li> It will also enable the [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Virtualization_Preview_Repository virt-preview] repository on your machine giving you access to the latest versions of things like libvirt and KVM.
</ul>
<li>Install oVirt Engine. <kbd><pre>sudo yum install -y ovirt-engine</pre></kbd>
<li> Optionally install the All-In-One plugin if you want to host VMs on your Engine Host <kbd><pre>sudo yum install -y ovirt-engine-setup-plugin-allinone</pre></kbd>
<li>Set up oVirt Engine. <kbd><pre>sudo engine-setup</pre></kbd>
<li> Follow the on screen prompts to configure and install the engine
<li>Once you have successfully installed oVirt Engine, you will be provided with instructions to access oVirt's web-based management interface.
<li>Congratulations! oVirt Engine is now installed!
<li>For every virtualization server you'd like to manage, you can now [[Quick Start Guide#Install_Hosts | set them up as oVirt hosts]] .

These instructions should work for both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS.  They will likely work with other binary compatible EL6 version as well, but they were not tested.  It is strongly recommended that you use at least version 6.4.
