The following section describes permissions for Network entities.

==== Network Actions ====
Current Action Groups and their associated Actions:

* CONFIGURE_STORAGE_POOL_NETWORK (on VdcObjectType.StoragePool) for actions:
** AddNetwork
** RemoveNetwork
** UpdateNetwork
* CONFIGURE_CLUSTER_NETWORK (on VdcObjectType.VdsGroups) for actions:
** AttachNetworkToVdsGroup
** DetachNetworkToVdsGroup
** UpdateNetworkOnCluster
* CONFIGURE_HOST_NETWORK (on VdcObjectType.VDS) for actions:
** SetupNetworks
** AddBond
** RemoveBond
** AttachNetworkToVdsInterface
** DetachNetworkFromVdsInterface
** UpdateNetworkToVdsInterface
** CommitNetworkChanges
* CONFIGURE_VM_NETWORK (on VdcObjectType.VM) for actions:
** ActivateDeactivateVmNic
** AddVmInterface
** RemoveVmInterface 
** UpdateVmInterface
* CONFIGURE_TEMPLATE_NETWORK (on VdcObjectType.VmTemplate) for actions:
** AddVmTemplateInterface
** RemoveVmTemplateInterface
** UpdateVmTemplateInterface
* PORT_MIRRORING (on VdcObjectType.VmInterface) for actions:
** AddVmInterface
** UpdateVmInterface

VdcObjectType.VmInterface already defined and in use by Port Mirroring

==== Roles ====
===== New Action Groups for Network Object Type =====


===== New Roles =====
An existing role "NETWORK_ADMIN" attached to groups MANIPUTLATE_HOST, CONFIGURE_HOST_NETWORK and CONFIGURE_CLUSTER_NETWORK. It is defined as administrator role having permission for all operations on a specific Logical Network.

===== Updated Roles =====


==== DB Changes ====
  Modify create_functions.sql:
  Add support for Network to ''fn_get_entity_parents'' stored-procedure.
  Add support for Network to ''fn_get_entity_name'' stored-procedure.

==== Upgrade DB ====
DB Upgrade should handle the following:


==== UI Changes ====
Add Permissions sub-tab under Networks main tab<BR>
Add Network Operator role to Roles Tree in:<BR>
  ''frontend/webadmin/modules/uicommonweb/src/main/java/org/ovirt/engine/ui/uicommonweb/models/configure/roles_ui/RoleTreeView.java''
  ''frontend/webadmin/modules/uicompat/src/main/java/org/ovirt/engine/ui/uicompat/Enums.java''
  ''frontend/webadmin/modules/uicompat/src/main/resources/org/ovirt/engine/ui/uicompat/Enums.properties''

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Permission management for Networks enhances the Network functionality, provides flexibility to users and protects it from misuse.<BR>
Granting permissions on Network to user is done via the Administrator Portal or using RESTful API.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
The Network Permissions is dependent on the following features:
* Network Main Tab

Affected oVirt projects:
* Engine-core
* Admin Portal

=== Open issues ===
* Network SLA - this feature should consider network permission when implemented.
