== Network Permissions ==

=== Summary ===
The Network Permissions feature is supplementary for network related actions in the system. It enables permissions management on a Network to control which user is allowed to perform what action when it relates to network.

=== Current status ===
* Status: Design Stage 
* Last updated date: Tue Oct 23 2012


=== Introduction ===
The authorization mechanism for controlling which actions a user is allowed to execute is named Multi-Level-Administrating (MLA) <BR>
Please refer to [http://wiki.ovirt.org/wiki/Action_Permissions_overview Action Permissions overview] for further information.

=== Design ===


The following section describes the permissions on Network entities.

==== Network's Actions ====
The '''existing Action Groups''' and their associated Actions:

* CONFIGURE_STORAGE_POOL_NETWORK (admin role, requires permissions on VdcObjectType.StoragePool) for actions:
** AddNetwork
** RemoveNetwork
** UpdateNetwork
* CONFIGURE_CLUSTER_NETWORK (admin role, on VdcObjectType.VdsGroups) for actions:
** AttachNetworkToVdsGroup
** DetachNetworkToVdsGroup
** UpdateNetworkOnCluster
* CONFIGURE_HOST_NETWORK (admin role, on VdcObjectType.VDS) for actions:
** SetupNetworks
** AddBond
** RemoveBond
** AttachNetworkToVdsInterface
** DetachNetworkFromVdsInterface
** UpdateNetworkToVdsInterface
** CommitNetworkChanges
* CONFIGURE_VM_NETWORK (user role, on VdcObjectType.VM) for actions:
** ActivateDeactivateVmNic
** AddVmInterface
** RemoveVmInterface 
** UpdateVmInterface
* CONFIGURE_TEMPLATE_NETWORK (user role, on VdcObjectType.VmTemplate) for actions:
** AddVmTemplateInterface
** RemoveVmTemplateInterface
** UpdateVmTemplateInterface
* PORT_MIRRORING (admin role, on VdcObjectType.VmInterface) for actions:
** AddVmInterface
** UpdateVmInterface

VdcObjectType.VmInterface is already defined and in use by Port Mirroring

==== Roles ====
===== New Action Groups for Network Object Type =====

===== New Roles =====
* '''VmNetworkUser''' a new user role to be associated with the following groups: CONFIGURE_VM_NETWORK and CONFIGURE_TEMPLATE_NETWORK.
** It should allow the user to create vnics attached to the subjected network or to update an existing vnic network.

===== Updated Roles =====
* '''NetworkAdmin''' is currently attached to groups MANIPUTLATE_HOST, CONFIGURE_HOST_NETWORK and CONFIGURE_CLUSTER_NETWORK.
** MANIPUTLATE_HOST has nothing to do with networking, therefore should be omitted from the aforementioned list.
** CONFIGURE_STORAGE_POOL_NETWORK should be added to the NetworkAdmin groups.
** The actions should be modified to require permission on Network and the main entity of each group (On Data Center and Cluster and on Network)
** Attaching a network to host's nic will not require permission on the attached network, rather on the host only.

===== Updated Action Groups =====
* '''PORT_MIRRORING''' should require permissions on both the Vm and the target Network.
** Suggestion: Once permission on Network is introduced, we can grant a user permission on a Network for PORT_MIRRORING role. It enables the user either to enable/disable a port mirroring for the network. By that we can also define the PORT_MIRRORING as a user role.

===== Updated Entities Hierarchy =====
The '''VmInterface''' should be removed from the the hierarchy. User having permission on VmInterface will have a permission on the VM instead as part of the upgrade script.
A new '''Network''' entity will be added as a child of '''Data-Center'''

===== Updated Queries =====
The following queries will be modified to be filtered by the user:
 GetAllNetworksByClusterIdQuery - available VM networks list presented to the User will include only network the user has permission on

==== DB Changes ====
Modify create_functions.sql:
  Add support for Network to ''fn_get_entity_parents'' stored-procedure.
  Add support for Network to ''fn_get_entity_name'' stored-procedure.
  Remove VmInterface from ''fn_get_entity_name'' and ''fn_get_entity_parents'' stored-procedure.

Add new view: 
  user_network_permissions_view
  An join of users to networks which the user has a permission on

==== Upgrade DB ====
DB Upgrade should handle the following:

* Permissions on all Data Center's Networks should be granted to any user owns permissions on Data-Center.
* Permissions on VmNetworkInterface should be replaced with permissions on the VM.
* NetworkAdmin role will be updated:
** include CONFIGURE_STORAGE_POOL_NETWORK
** exclude MANIPULATE_HOST_STATUS

==== UI Changes ====
Add Permissions sub-tab under Networks main tab<BR>
Add Network User role to Roles Tree in:<BR>
  ''frontend/webadmin/modules/uicommonweb/src/main/java/org/ovirt/engine/ui/uicommonweb/models/configure/roles_ui/RoleTreeView.java''
  ''frontend/webadmin/modules/uicompat/src/main/java/org/ovirt/engine/ui/uicompat/Enums.java''
  ''frontend/webadmin/modules/uicompat/src/main/resources/org/ovirt/engine/ui/uicompat/Enums.properties''


=== Behaviour Change ===

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Permission management for Networks enhances the Network functionality, provides flexibility to users and protects it from misuse.<BR>
Granting permissions on Network to user is done via the Administrator Portal or using RESTful API.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
The Network Permissions is dependent on the following features:
* Network Main Tab

Affected oVirt projects:
* Engine-core
* Admin Portal

=== Open issues ===
* Network SLA - this feature should consider network permission when implemented.
