== Current phase ==
phase 1

== Phases ==
=== Phase 1 ===
* Analysis of technologies available for accessing oVirt REST API. 
* Creation of basic (offline) app to test possible moVirt UI and UX

== iOS specific limitations ==
iOS does not give application developers much freedom when the application is in the background. There are 2 hacks, often causing rejection in App Store:
* using e.g. music API with silent track to keep the app active in the background and
* using VoIP API.
The supported solution is declaring a class of background actions the app can execute, which in our case is <code>fetch</code> or <code>remote-notification</code>. In first case,
moVirt would be able to periodically poll Engine or doctor REST for batch updates. The second case is a bit more complex as it involves use of APNS, therefore sending possibly sensitive
data to Apple servers. <code>fetch</code> mode also comes with a small caveat: "Enabling this mode is not a guarantee that the system will give your app any time to perform background fetches.".

It seems that currently, given limitations and choices, <code>fetch</code> is the best way of getting fresh data center state to moVirt.
