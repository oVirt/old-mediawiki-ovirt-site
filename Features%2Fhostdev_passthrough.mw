=== VDSM side ===
Unlike virtual devices, PCI passthrough uses real host hardware, making the number of such assigned devices limited.
VDSM will report available devices in vdsCapabilities using keyword hostDevices. The list itself does not (and by philosophy
of host capabilities cannot) report the assignments itself. These are reported in VM devices section, identified by type 'hostdev'.

Structures
<pre>
vdsCapabilities 'hostDevices': [{'name': '...', 'capability': '...', 'vendor': '...', 'product': '...'}]
VM: 'devices': [... {'type': 'hostdev', 'name': '...', 'capability': '...'} ...]
</pre>

Engine wil receive name, capability, vendor and product of the device
- name: unique string containing physical address of the device, guaranteed to be host-unique
- capability: type of the device (pci, usb, scsi and possibly more in the future - scsi targets, hosts etc.)
- vendor, product: human-readable identifiers of the device, possibly not unique

=== Migration ===
Migration should be disabled for any VM with hostdev device.

=== Engine side ===
Engine needs to internally keep track of device assignments for individual hosts. Device assignment should preferably
look similar to virt-manager, displaying list of (name product vendor) available for assignment.
