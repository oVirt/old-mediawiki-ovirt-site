=== VDSM side ===
Unlike virtual devices, PCI passthrough uses real host hardware, making the number of such assigned devices limited.
VDSM will report available devices in vdsCapabilities using keyword hostDevices. The list itself does not (and by philosophy
cannot)  report the assignments itself. These are reported in VM devices section, identified by type 'hostdev'.

Structures
<pre>
vdsCapabilities 'hostDevices': [{'name': '...', 'vendor': '...', 'product': '...'}]
VM: 'devices': [... {'type': 'hostdev', 'name': '...', 'vendor': '...', 'product': '...'} ...]
</pre>

Hot(un)plug is accomplished by hotplugHostdev and hotunplugHostdev calls, which only take vmId and name field of the
device to be added/removed.

==== Migration ====
Migration should be disabled for any VM with hostdev device.

=== Engine side ===
Engine needs to internally keep track of device assignments for individual hosts. Device assignment should preferably
look similar to virt-manager, displaying list of (name product vendor) available for assignment. User also needs to have
a way of hot(un)plugging these devices.
