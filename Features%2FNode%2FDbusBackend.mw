=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
Th main reason for this change it to adopt a common used UI for the oVirt Node.  <br/>
The use of Dbus will provide control of oVirt Node in manner that is familiar to many developers out of the oVirt community. <br/>
Lastly, we can utilize common platform code and reduce the amount of duplicated work.

The Dbus provider will run as a separate service not tied to invocation of the TUI.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
Moving further away from tight coupling with the TUI and onto Dbus allows easy access to the configuration API from any frontend or language that has Dbus bindings.
Additionally, moving towards Dbus means less logical separation when we start using Dbus interfaces not provided by Node.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->
Having a usable Dbus backend makes integration with [[Features/Node/Cockpit | Cockpit]] much better.

=== Testing ===
Classes from ovirt.node.config.defaults should be visible on the Dbus Session Bus
Activation of methods with dbus-send or python-dbus (example Python to follow later) will work, and trigger the appropriate backend classes.
