# VDSM sends a 'login' message to the oVirt Guest Agent
# The oVirt Guest Agent daemon/service receives the message and creates a 6 character long random token
# The Guest Agent creates a UNIX Domain Socket on '\x00/tmp/ovirt-cred-channel' and listens to it for 5 seconds to receive
# The Guest Agent triggers the Credentials UserAuthenticated signal which the GDM/KDM plug-ins are subscribing to
# Once triggered, the KDM/GDM plugin initiates a new login by using the gdm-ovirtcred pam stack
# The pam module requests the Token from the GDM module
# The pam module sends the Token to the ovirt-cred-channel UNIX Domain socket
# The pam module receives the username/password combination and reaches the login information down the pam stack
# If the login credentials are valid, the user is authenticated and the Desktop session started
