== Required Networks ==

=== Summary ===
Required networks are a part of monitoring process the engine does, to make sure all the <br>
host in clusters are eligible for migration (cluster is sometimes referred to as the '''migration-domain''') <br>
A cluster network which is required but missing from a host will cause the host to be in <br> 
non-operational state, thus it can not be activated till it has the network attached. <br>
- Till now, all networks were required , now its optional.

=== Detailed Description ===
Refer to [[Required_Networks_detailed]]

=== Benefit to oVirt ===

# coming gluster-cluster support which is a cluster that doesn't have migration prospects.
# pinned to host VMs that uses networks we don't want other hosts to implement needlessly.
# 3rd parties doing network management outside of ovirt.

=== REST API ===

when attaching a network to a cluster, add a boolean required property to it

 POST api/clusters/{id}/networks
 <network id="28372223-881c-4996-81f2-936c6cc2c874">
  <name>test</name>
  <required>false</required>
 </network>
