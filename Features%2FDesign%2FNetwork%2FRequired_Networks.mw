== Required Networks ==

=== Summary ===
Required networks are a part of monitoring process the engine does to make sure all the <br>
host in clusters can be ready for migration (cluster is sometimes referred to as the migration-domain) <br>
A cluster network which is required but missing from a host will cause the host to be in <br> 
non-operational state, thus it can not be activated till it has the network attached. <br>
- Till now, all networks were required by default, now its optional.

=== Detailed Description ===
Refer to [[Required_Networks_detailed]]

=== Benefit to oVirt ===

# coming gluster-cluster support which is a cluster that doesn't have migration prospects.
# pinned to host VMs that uses networks we don't want other hosts to implement needlessly.
# 3rd parties doing network management outside of ovirt.
