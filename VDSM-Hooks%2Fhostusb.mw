{{Feature|name=Expose Host attached USB to a Node|modules=[Node(s) of feature]|version=[oVirt version number]|status=Released}}

hostusb adds host's usb device/s to VM. 
This hook is useful for VMs that need to access USB devices attached to the hypervisor host, most commonly HASP plugs

VM XML changes:
 <hostdev mode='subsystem' type='usb'>
     <source>
         <vendor id='0x1234'/>
         <product id='0xbeef'/>
     </source>
 </hostdev>

Syntax:
    hostusb=0x1234:0xbeef&0x2222:0xabaa
This maps to:
    hostusb=VendorId:ProductId&AnotherVendorId:AnotherProductId... 

Note: The VM must be pinned to host and this hook will fail any migration attempt.

Host attached USB devices can be viewed with <code>lsusb</code>
