== Description ==
As part of [[Features/Self_Hosted_Engine_iSCSI_Support | Self Hosted Engine iSCSI Support Feature]] this case is meant to test setup when multiple LUN are available on the iSCSI target.

See {{BZ|1125315}} -  Hosted Engine on iSCSI setup doesn't allow LUN choice

== Setup ==
You can follow https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Scsi-target-utils_Quickstart_Guide for setting up tgtd, just repeat the step "Add a logical unit (LUN)" increasing the value passed to --lun for each lun you add. 

==How to test==
# Install ovirt-hosted-engine-setup
# Run hosted-engine --deploy
# Select iSCSI storage
# Select the iSCSI target with multiple LUN

==Expected Results==
* Hosted engine setup should detect all the available LUNs and ask you which one has to be used
