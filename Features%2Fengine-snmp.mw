=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Allows ovirt-engine-notifier users the ability to subscribe to events under different notification methods and profiles.

=== Detailed Description ===
A new 'Event subscribers' section is now available in the notifier's configuration file under<br/>
/share/ovirt-engine/services/ovirt-engine-notifier/ovirt-engine-notifier.conf <br />
(It's advisable to leave that file as is and define override file[s] under etc/ovirt-engine/notifier/notifier.conf.d/)
Lets take a look;

 # can be overridden per event list.
 # -: notify on all events except for those listed in FILTER.
 # +: notify only on events listed in FILTER.
 #
 # DEFAULT_FILTER_MODE=-|+
 DEFAULT_FILTER_MODE=-
 
 # A whitespace separated events list.
 # each element contains an event list, an optional notification method, an optional profile and
 # an optional filter mode.
 #
 # Examples:
 # 1.) send VDC START and STOP to all notification methods using their default profiles. assumes default filter is +.
 # FILTER="VDC_START,VDC_STOP"
 #
 # 2.) add notifications on all but 2 events to the default mail subscriber as well as to mike@example.com.
 # MAIL_SUBSCRIBER=admin@example.com
 # MAIL_SUBSCRIBER_MIKE=mike@example.com
 # FILTER="${FILTER} -DATABASE_UNREACHABLE,SYSTEM_VDS_RESTART(MAIL) -DATABASE_UNREACHABLE,SYSTEM_VDS_RESTART(MAIL:MIKE)"
 #
 # 3.) add a new snmp subscriber to all events using default definitions, overriding only the oid.
 # SNMP_OID_DAVE=1.2.3.4
 # FILTER="${FILTER} -(SNMP:DAVE)"

=== Whats in a profile? ===
A profile defines a target and data associated with it. For MAIL it is simply an email address defined by MAIL_SUBSCRIBER.<br/>
For SNMP a profile consists of SNMP_MANAGERS, SNMP_COMMUNITY and SNMP_OID (see snmp feature page for additional info).<br/>
