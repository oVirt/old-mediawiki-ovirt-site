Allow oVirt users to monitor their virtualization environment with open source or proprietary monitoring systems such as Nagios, BMC Patrol, HP OpenView, etc.

=== Detailed Description ===
This feature extends the capabilities of the event notifier to send all engine events and events' data via SNMP traps version 2c. <br />
SNMP parameters  are available in  oVirt event notifier configuration file /etc/ovirt-engine/notifier/notifier.conf<br /><br />

New parameters in configuration file: <br />

SNMP_MANAGER= IP address or DNS name of the SNMP service to  receive SNMP traps sent from oVirt event notifier. empty by default.
At least one of (SNMP_MANAGER|MAIL_SERVER)  must be properly defined in order for the notifier to run.
SNMP_PORT= Default is 162. <br/>
SNMP_COMMUNITY= A community string to be used in traps. Default is 'public'.
SNMP_OID= An Object Identifier identifying ovirt engine SNMP trap messages. Default 1.3.6.1.4.1.2312.13.1 which stands for:
1[iso].3[organization].6[DoD].1[Internet].4[private].1[enterprises].2312[redhat].13[ovirt-engine].1[audit-log] see messages for details.

WHITELIST= a comma separated list of trap generating event names. by default this is commented out
BLACKLIST= a comma separated list of ignored events names. by default this is ''.

Note: As you can see from the above, by default all events will generate traps.
Note: If both WHITELIST and BLACKLIST are defined,  only WHITELIST is considered.
