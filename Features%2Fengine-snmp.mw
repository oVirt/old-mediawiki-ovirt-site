=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Allow oVirt users to monitor their virtualization environment with open source or proprietary monitoring systems such as Nagios, BMC Patrol, HP OpenView, etc.

=== Detailed Description ===
This feature extends the capabilities of the ovirt-engine-notifier to send all engine events and events' data via SNMP traps version 2c. <br />
SNMP parameters  are available in  ovirt-engine-notifier default configuration file: /share/ovirt-engine/services/ovirt-engine-notifier/ovirt-engine-notifier.conf <br />
(It's advisable to leave that file as is and define an override file under etc/ovirt-engine/notifier/notifier.conf.d/)

 #-------------------------#
 # SNMP_TRAP Notifications #
 #-------------------------#
 # Send v2c snmp notifications
 
 # IP address or DNS name of an SNMP manager to receive SNMP traps.
 SNMP_MANAGER=
 
 # The snmp manager's port
 SNMP_PORT=162
 
 # community string
 SNMP_COMMUNITY=public
 
 # Object Identifier identifying ovirt engine SNMP trap messages.
 SNMP_OID=1.3.6.1.4.1.2312.13.1
 
 # comma separated list of event names to notify on.
 #WHITELIST=""
 
 # notify on all but these comma separated list of events:
 BLACKLIST=""
 
 # note: if both WHITELIST and BLACKLIST are defined only WHITELIST is considered.

Notes:
* At least one of (SNMP_MANAGER|MAIL_SERVER)  must be properly defined in order for the notifier to run.
* SNMP_OID stands for :
 1[iso].3[organization].6[DoD].1[Internet].4[private].1[enterprises].2312[redhat].13[ovirt-engine].1[audit-log]
see messages section for details.
* Since by default WHITELIST is commented out and BLACKLIST is "", if  an SNMP_MANAGER is defined all events will generate traps.

Using the default value for SNMP_OID (1.3.6.1.4.1.2312.13.1), traps will show up as:
 SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2312.13.1.0.30	SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2312.13.1.0.30.0 = STRING: "User admin@internal logged in."
