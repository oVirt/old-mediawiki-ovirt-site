== oVirt Engine SNMP Traps <!-- The name of your feature --> ==

=== Summary ===
This feature extends events notifier capabilities and enables it to generate SNMP traps out of system events to integrate oVirt with generic monitoring systems.

=== Current status ===
* Target Release: 3.4
* Status: Post
* Last updated: {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}<!--This is markup for current date, do not change-->

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Allow oVirt users to monitor their virtualization environment with open source or proprietary monitoring systems such as Nagios, BMC Patrol, HP OpenView, etc.

=== Detailed Description ===
This feature extends the capabilities of the ovirt-engine-notifier to send all engine events and events' data via SNMP traps version 2c. <br />
Note that in contrary to email notification added through the UI, where only a subset of events are defined, here all events are sent by edfault.<br/>
SNMP parameters  are available in  ovirt-engine-notifier default configuration file: /share/ovirt-engine/services/ovirt-engine-notifier/ovirt-engine-notifier.conf <br />
(It's advisable to leave that file as is and define an override file under etc/ovirt-engine/notifier/notifier.conf.d/)

Notes:
* At least one of (SNMP_MANAGER|MAIL_SERVER)  must be properly defined in order for the notifier to run.
* Since by default WHITELIST is commented out and BLACKLIST is "", if  an SNMP_MANAGER is defined all events will generate traps.

=== Messages ===

Using the default value for SNMP_OID (1.3.6.1.4.1.2312.13.1), traps will show up as:
 SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2312.13.1.0.30	SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2312.13.1.0.30.0 = STRING: "User admin@internal logged in."	SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2312.13.1.0.30.1 = STRING: "NORMAL"	SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2312.13.1.0.30.2 = STRING: "alertMessage"	SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2312.13.1.0.30.3 = STRING: "2014-01-12 07:14:22.576"

* SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID represents the trap id for this event. we have our OID appended with 0 (because this is an enterprise specific trap). finally 30 is appended as well. This value is specific to this trap type: USER_VDC_LOGIN.

* After that you can see different values associated with this trap:

=== Testing ===
This section contains instructions on setting up an snmp manager capable of receiving traps.<br/>
Tested under fedora 20 (please update if it worked for you on a different version).
 
 # yum install -y net-snmp

Edit the trap daemon configuration file, /etc/snmp/snmptrapd.conf:
 # Example configuration file for snmptrapd
 #
 # No traps are handled by default, you must edit this file!
 #
 authCommunity   log,execute,net public
 # traphandle SNMPv2-MIB::coldStart    /usr/bin/bin/my_great_script cold
 [snmp]
 logOption f /tmp/snmptrapd.log

Start the service:
 # service snmptrapd start

Test service by sending a trap:
 # yum install -y  net-snmp-utils
 $ snmptrap -v 2c -c public localhost '' 1.2 SNMPv2-MIB::sysLocation.0 s "just here"

Incoming traps should now be available in /tmp/snmptrapd.log.
