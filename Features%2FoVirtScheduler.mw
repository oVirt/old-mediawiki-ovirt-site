== oVirt Scheduler [WIP] ==
=== Summary ===
As long oVirt is progressing and continue to gather features, there is an ever growing actual need for better scheduling: configurable, customized and flexible, both in the programmatic and functionality levels.
It is known that the scheduling problem has NP-complete complexity, therefore there's a need to optimize the problem solution, to do that each scheduler implementation should focus on it's own subjective needs. To accomplish that we propose to have a scheduling API architecture, in which the clients can have their own private optimized schedulers.
This page includes the high-level design for the new scheduling model.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
* Allow others to integrate with oVirt's Scheduler.
* Allow users to add their own scheduling logic.
* Should allow other languages (Python), run as script/dynamically.
* Load balancing policies can be overwritten.
* Provides modularity and boundaries.

=== Description ===
====oVirt Scheduler concepts====
* Filter: a basic logic unit which filters out hypervisors who do not satisfy the hard constraints for placing a given VM.
* Cost function: a function that gives a score to a given host based on its internal logic. This is a way to implement soft constraints in the scheduling process.


* Supports filters for hard constraints and cost functions for soft constraints.
* Load balancing policies related to filters and cost functions.
* Existing logic (pin-to-host, memory limitations, etc) will be translated into filters.
* Existing load balancing policies will be translated to the new format.
* Additional policies, filters and cost functions may be added by users.
* Supports Python (we may be able to allow others as well).

=== Functionality ===
==== Schedule ====
    Filter
    Cost Function

====Balance====
   Called periodically.
    Each cluster may use a single balancing logic at any given time.
