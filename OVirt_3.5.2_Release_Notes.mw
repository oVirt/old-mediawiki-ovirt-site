If you are upgrading from a previous version, you may have the ovirt-release34 package already installed on your system.
You can then install ovirt-release35.rpm as in a clean install side-by-side.

Once ovirt-release35 package is installed,  you will have the ovirt-3.5-stable repository and any other repository needed for satisfying dependencies enabled by default.

If you're installing oVirt 3.5.1 on a clean host, you should read our [[Quick Start Guide]].

Please see [[oVirt 3.4.1 release notes]] for upgrade instructions.

For upgrading now you just need to execute:
 # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
 # engine-setup

== oVirt Hosted Engine ==

If you're going to install oVirt as Hosted Engine on a clean system please follow [[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install]] guide.

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow [[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine]] guide.

= What's New in 3.5.2? =

=Known issues=
* NFS startup on EL7 / Fedora20: due to other bugs ({{BZ|1144440}}  or {{BZ|1066959}} ), NFS service is not always able to start at first attempt (it doesn't wait the kernel module to be ready); if it happens oVirt engine setup detects it and aborts with
 [ INFO  ] Restarting nfs services
 [ ERROR ] Failed to execute stage 'Closing up': Command '/bin/systemctl' failed to execute
Retrying (engine-cleanup, engine-setup again) it's enough to avoid it cause the kernel module it's always ready on further attempts. Manually starting NFS service (/bin/systemctl restart nfs-server.service) before running engine setup it's enough to avoid it at all.
