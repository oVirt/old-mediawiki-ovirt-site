* Last updated: 2013-05-22

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
An offshoot of the [[Features/Universal Image|Universal Node Image]] feature.  This plugin can be used to convert a generic oVirt Node image into an image ready for use with oVirt Engine.  


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
Because of the [[Features/Universal Image|Universal Node Image]] feature, there would be no more oVirt Node image available with the oVirt Project.  This plugin is simply the moving of the logic for interacting with oVirt Engine from oVirt Node into a plugin.

In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate?
