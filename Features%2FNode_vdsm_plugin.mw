== oVirt Node VDSM plugin <!-- The name of your feature --> ==

=== Summary ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
This feature converts the generic oVirt Node image into an image customized use with oVirt Engine.


=== Owner ===
<!--This should link to your home wiki page so we know who you are-->
* Name: [[User:mburns| Mike Burns]]

<!-- Include you email address that you can be reached should people want to contact you about helping with your feature, status is requested, or  technical issues need to be resolved-->
* Email: mburns AT redhat DOT com
* IRC:  mburns


=== Current status ===
* Initial code base uploaded, initial test images [http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/node-base/beta/iso/ available], should be ready for oVirt 3.3 beta
* Last updated: 2013-05-22

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
An offshoot of the [[Features/Universal Image|Universal Node Image]] feature.  This plugin can be used to convert a generic oVirt Node image into an image ready for use with oVirt Engine.  


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
Because of the [[Features/Universal Image|Universal Node Image]] feature, there would be no more oVirt Node image available with the oVirt Project.  This plugin is simply the moving of the logic for interacting with oVirt Engine from oVirt Node into a plugin.


=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->
