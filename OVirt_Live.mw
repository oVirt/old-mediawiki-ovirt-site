== Why do we need it? ==
This version can be used for POC or demos, and suppose to give a sneak preview for the working product operation.

simplify the the installation for new users, and will allow users to experiment with oVirt before later installing it.


== How can I use it? ==
oVirt Live comes as a live os, you can either use it:

=== DVD ===
read only (all changes will be gone upon reboot)

=== USB ===
can be used either as read only or with persistent storage

=== VM ===
you can run this iso on a vm, using nested virtualization you can run nested vms within it.

the flow which worked for me:

 <nowiki>
 # cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested
 N
 # vi /etc/default/grub
 GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rd.md=0 rd.dm=0  KEYTABLE=us SYSFONT=True rd.lvm.lv=vg/lv_root rd.luks=0 rd.lvm.lv=vg/lv_swap LANG=en_US.UTF-8 rhgb quiet kvm-intel.nested=1" #Add kvm-intel.nested=1 in the end of the boot options
 # grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
 #reboot
 # virsh capabilities  (collecting data from hypervisor)
  ...
    <cpu>
      <model>Penryn</model>
      <vendor>Intel</vendor>
      <feature policy='require' name='vmx'/>
    </cpu>
  ....
 </nowiki>
create a vm with your favourite manager (ovirt ;)
add the <cpu> output from virsh to your vm xml adding match='exact' to <cpu>

 <nowiki>
 # vi /etc/libvirt/qemu/your_vm_name
 <cpu match='exact'>
 ...
 </cpu>
 </nowiki>
