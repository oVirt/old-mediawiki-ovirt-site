== An overview how the single sign on process works on Microsoft Windows&reg; systems  ==
[[File:Ovirt-guest-agent-sso-windows.png]]
# VDSM sends a 'login' message to the oVirt Guest Agent
# In case the "SAS" library is installed, the service will simulate a "Secure attention sequence" by issuing a SendSAS(0) call on the SAS library
# The service then will send the credentials to a named Pipe ("\\\\.\\pipe\\VDSMPipe") via the CallNamedPipe system call
# The plugin either GINA on Windows XP&reg; or the Credentials Provider on Windows 7&reg; will issue the login process with the credentials received.
# If the login credentials are valid, the user is authenticated and the Desktop session started
