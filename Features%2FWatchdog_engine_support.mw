=== Detailed Description ===


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Users will be able to add watchdog cards to their virtual machines. This will be especially important for highly available  servers.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
This feature depends on the [[Sla/Watchdog_Device|VDSM support for the watchdog cards]] (merged)
The related patches:
* [http://gerrit.ovirt.org/7535 device support]
* [http://gerrit.ovirt.org/9429 watchdog events support]

=== Documentation / External references ===

For libvirt support, please see [http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsWatchdog libvirt's documentation on watchdog support].

==== User Interface ====

The watchdog support on the UI will be found on the new/edit VM/template window, on the high availablity tab, since mostly you need the watchdog in HA setups.

You can also find a user interface live demo on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dJLmLxXn4o youtube]

===== Desktop =====

The desktop will have the very same HA tab as the server. This is a somewhat unrelated change, but the difference between desktop and server VM's is about to be removed.

==== Backend changes ====

* Both Vm and Template will have support for watchdog cards
* Watchdog card is represented by a VmDevice

==== Watchdog notifications ====

* Since users must be aware of the watchdog operations, vdsm reports the last action taken by a watchdog for each VM in getVmStats.
* This actions should be translated into system events
  * An event will show up in the Web Admin.
  * Users should be able to subscribe to watchdog event, so they will get a notification via the notification service.

==== Database changes  ====

* none

==== REST Api changes ====

In REST API the VM and template will get a new optional tag '''watchdog''' directly under te vm tag. Watchdog tag will have two mandatory attributes: model and action

 <vm id="87cd09df-88af-4958-8aba-87b14b92ca39" href="/api/vms/87cd09df-88af-4958-8aba-87b14b92ca39">
  <name>test</name>
  <description>123456</description>
  <link rel="disks" href="/api/vms/87cd09df-88af-4958-8aba-87b14b92ca39/disks"/>
  <link rel="nics" href="/api/vms/87cd09df-88af-4958-8aba-87b14b92ca39/nics"/>
  <link rel="cdroms" href="/api/vms/87cd09df-88af-4958-8aba-87b14b92ca39/cdroms"/>
  <link rel="snapshots" href="/api/vms/87cd09df-88af-4958-8aba-87b14b92ca39/snapshots"/>
  <link rel="tags" href="/api/vms/87cd09df-88af-4958-8aba-87b14b92ca39/tags"/>
  <link rel="permissions" href="/api/vms/87cd09df-88af-4958-8aba-87b14b92ca39/permissions"/>
  <link rel="statistics" href="/api/vms/87cd09df-88af-4958-8aba-87b14b92ca39/statistics"/>
  <link rel="reporteddevices" href="/api/vms/87cd09df-88af-4958-8aba-87b14b92ca39/reporteddevices"/>
  <type>server</type>
  <status>
  <state>down</state>
  </status>
  <memory>536870912</memory>
  ...
 '''<link rel="watchdogs" href="/api/vms/87cd09df-88af-4958-8aba-87b14b92ca39/watchdogs"/>'''
  ...
 </vm>

and then in the referenced watchdog url you will see something like this

 <watchdogs>
  <watchdog>
    <model>i6300esb</model>
    <action>reset</action>
  </watchdog>
 <watchdogs>

Note here that there can be only one watchdog. 

The watchdog cards and available actions will also get a list in the engine capabilities list (api/capabilities)

 <watchdog_models>
  <watchdog_model>i6300esb</watchdog_model>
  <watchdog_model>ib700</watchdog_model>
 </watchdog_models>

 <watchdog_actions>
  <watchdog_action>dump</watchdog_action>
  <watchdog_action>reset</watchdog_action>
  <watchdog_action>none</watchdog_action>
  ....
 </watchdog_actions>

==== VDSM support ====

VDSM support for watchdog cards is already merged.

=== Test cases ===

* detecting the watchdog
** i6300esb is a pci device, the command ''`lspci | grep watchdog -i`'' in a guest linux OS will show you the watchdog card if it is installed
** ib700: TODO

==== Create VM with watchdog (UI) ====

# Create a server VM
# set VM name
# click on "High Availability"
# set watchdog card to ''''i6300esb''' and watchdog action to '''reset'''
# save VM
# click on the new VM in the list
# click '''edit'''
# check if the watchdog device is set correctly
# use the rest api to see if the VM has the watchdog card
# click cancel
# start the VM
# click on the console icon to open SPICE console
# boot any linux distribution on the VM
# see if watchdog card is installed

==== Remove watchdog from VM (UI) ====

Depends on [[#Create VM with watchdog (UI)|Create VM with watchdog (UI)]]

# create vm with watchdog (see above)
# edit vm
# go to '''high availablity''' tab
# set the watchdog model to empty
# save VM
# check on restapi, the watchdog tag must not appear now on the VM

==== Create template with watchdog (UI) ====

Dependens on [[#Create_VM_with_watchdog_(UI)]]

# Create a server VM
# set VM name
# click on "High Availability"
# set watchdog card to ''''i6300esb''' and watchdog action to '''reset'''
# save VM
# create template from vm
# go to the templates tab
# click on the newly created template
# click on '''edit'''
# click on '''high availablity'''
# check if watchdog is set correctly

==== Create vm with watchdog from template (UI) ====

Depends:  [[#Create_template_with_watchdog_.28UI.29|Create vm with watchdog from template (UI)]]

# go to the '''Virtual Machines''' tab
# click on the '''new server''' button
# select the template with watchdog as template
# save the VM
# edit the newvly created VM
# go to the '''high availability''' tab
# check that the watchdog settings are the same as in the template

==== Create vm with watchdog (REST-API) ====

# use the rest api to create a vm with a <watchdog> tag ([[#REST Api changes|see above]])
# check on the rest api if the watchdog card is persisted

==== Add watchdog to existing VM (REST-API) ====

# use the rest api to create a vm with a <watchdog> tag ([[#REST Api changes|see above]])
# check on the rest api if the watchdog card is persisted

==== Remove watchdog from VM (REST-API) ====
