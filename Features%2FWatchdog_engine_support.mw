==== Backend changes ====

* Both Vm and Template will have support for watchdog cards, therefore VmBase will be extended with a watchdog property.
* New WatchDog class will represent the watchdog card and action. If watchdog is null in VmBase, it means that no watchdog is supported. Watchdog will have two properties: model and action
* vdsbroker must be extended in order to send the watchdog parameters to vdsm uppon Vm start
* VmTemplateDAODbFacadeImpl and VmDAODbFacadeImpl must be extended to support persistence of the Watchdog settings
