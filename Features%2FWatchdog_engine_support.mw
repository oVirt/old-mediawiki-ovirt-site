=== Detailed Description ===


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Users will be able to add watchdog cards to their virtual machines. This will be especially important for highly available  servers.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
This feature depends on the VDSM support for the watchdog cards (merged) (where is the documentation for this?)

==== Backend changes ====

* Both Vm and Template will have support for watchdog cards, therefore VmBase will be extended with a watchdog property.
* New WatchDog class will represent the watchdog card and action. If watchdog is null in VmBase, it means that no watchdog is supported. Watchdog will have two properties: model and action
* vdsbroker must be extended in order to send the watchdog parameters to vdsm uppon Vm start
* VmTemplateDAODbFacadeImpl and VmDAODbFacadeImpl must be extended to support persistence of the Watchdog settings

==== Database changes  ====

* table vm_static must be extended with two new columns
:* wd_model varchar(8) default null - for the watchdog model
:* wd_action varchar(8) default null - for the watchdog action (it must be one of [reset, poweroff, pause, none, dump]) possibly the best available solution for this would be postgresql enums, and these actions '''feedback is needed here'''
* Database stored procedures for update and add vm and template must be modified to handle the two above columns

==== REST Api changes ====

In REST API the VM and template will get a new optional tag ''''watchdog''' Watchdog will have two mandatory attributes: model and action

'''example needed here'''

==== VDSM support ====

VDSM support for watchdog cards is already merged.
