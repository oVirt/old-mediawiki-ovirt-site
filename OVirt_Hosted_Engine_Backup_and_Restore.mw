=oVirt Hosted Engine Backup and Restore=
<big>'''DRAFT - This procedure is still under testing'''</big>


== Test environment ==
* 2 hosts with EL 6.6 and HE from 3.5.3 GA
* 1 VM with EL 6.6 and engine from 3.5.3 GA
* NFSv3 storage on a different server

== Full storage domain backup ==

=== Backup ===

* # hosted-engine --set-maintenance --mode=global
* # hosted-engine --vm-shutdown
* backup the data domain. hints:
** block: dd if=<iscsi lun containing the he domain> |xz >he_domain.xz
** nfs: tar cJf he_domain.tar.xz . -C <path to sd directory>
* # hosted-engine --set-maintenance --mode=none

In order to simulate storage corruption you can destroy the content of the sd

=== Restore: ===

==== Preconditions ==== 
* hosts are still working
* the vm is not available anymore due to storage corruption
* an empty shared storage is available
* storage domain backup exists

==== Restore procedure====
* # service ovirt-ha-broker stop
* # service ovirt-ha-agent stop
* restore the data domain. hints:
** block: xz -d -c he_domain.xz dd of=<iscsi lun containing the he domain> |xz >he_domain.xz
** nfs: tar xJf he_domain.tar.xz -C <path to sd directory>
* # service ovirt-ha-broker start
* # service ovirt-ha-agent start
* # hosted-engine --set-maintenance --mode=none

== Application backup / restore ==
=== Backup: ===

* # hosted-engine --set-maintenance --mode=global
* within the HE vm:
** # service ovirt-engine stop
** # engine-backup --mode=backup --file=backup1 --log=backup1.log
** # service ovirt-engine start
* # hosted-engine --set-maintenance --mode=none

=== Restore: ===
==== Preconditions ====
* hosts are still working
* the vm is not available anymore due to storage corruption
* an empty shared storage is available
* engine backup exists

==== Restore procedure====
* on all the hosts:
** # service ovirt-ha-broker stop
** # service ovirt-ha-agent stop
** # chkconfig --del ovirt-ha-broker
** # chkconfig --del ovirt-ha-agent

* on first host:
** # hosted-engine --deploy
*** use same fqdn you had previously in the HE VM.
*** point to the new shared storage
*** provide the same admin password you used in previous setup
*** install the OS on the vm
*** confirm it has been installed
*** install the ovirt-engine rpms on the vm but don't run engine-setup
*** follow http://www.ovirt.org/Ovirt-engine-backup
*** remove the hosts used for Hosted Engine from the engine
*** confirm that the engine has been installed
*** first host should be a added cleanly to the engine
*** finish the deploy
*** wait for the engine to be started by the HA daemons

* on additional hosts run:
** # hosted-engine --deploy as if the host was clean.
