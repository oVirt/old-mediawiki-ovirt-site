== Remote DB ==

=== Summary ===
Remote DB feature means working with a Postgres instance on a remote host.

=== Owner ===
* Name: [[User:Alourie| Alex Lourie]]
* Email: <alourie@redhat.com>


=== Current status ===
The code was developed and is waiting for code review.

=== Design and flow ===

The flow of installation is as follows:

==== Setup ====

* During the engine-setup operation, user is asked to enter DB hostname or an IP. Default value 'localhost' is offered.
 * If entered 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1', the installation will continue with default flow present today.
 * If entered a hostname or IP of the remote host, the additional set of questions will be presented.
   * Additional questions include: DB Admin username, DB Port and "Security usage" parameters.
* Installation proceeds with normal flow.
* During the normal flow, additional parameters (if entered by user) are used during DB creation and JBoss configuration.

DB configuration parameters are stored in '''~/.pgpass file''', including remote host, port and username/password.
JBoss configuration is stored in '''/usr/share/jboss-as/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml''' file.

* If setup is rerun, the same parameter are used in "upgradeDb" function. Also, see next section for the upgrade logic.

==== Upgrade ====

* During the upgrade, the DB connection values are received from ~/.pgpass file and used for connection.
* The upgrade works as follows:
 * First, the packages are upgraded is necessary.
 * Before performing the DB upgrade, a backup is taken.
 * After the backup, the default DB (engine) is renamed to engine-<date>
  * If renaming fails, yum rollback is performed, and user is notified about possible active connections.
  * If renaming succeeds, DB upgrade is started.
 * If upgrade fails, the renamed DB is removed and yum rollback is performed.
 * If upgrade succeeds, the engine-<date> is renamed back to 'engine'.

==== Cleanup ====

* During the upgrade, the DB connection values are received from ~/.pgpass file and used for connection.
* If DB drop fails user is notified about possible active connections.

=== Comments and Discussion ===

Currently there are two questions we need to get answer to:

 1. What if potential customer asks us to create certificate for the DB?
 2. What kind of permissions we can receive on remote DB?

=== FAQ: ===
 Q. Can DB admin close active connections?
 A. No, this requires superuser privileges.

 Q. Can DB admin rename the DB?
 A. Only if DB admin is the DB owner.
