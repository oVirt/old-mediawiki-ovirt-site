==Reporting security issues==

Please report any security issues you find in oVirt projects to:

security@ovirt.org

Anyone can post to this list. The subscribers are only trusted individuals who will handle the resolution of any reported security issues in confidence. In your report, please note how you would like to be credited for discovering the issue and the details of any embargo you would like to impose. You will be credited for discovering any genuine issue sent to this list, and the issue will be handled under the conditions of the embargo you nominate.

==Handling security issues==

If you represent an oVirt project or a distribution which packages oVirt projects, you are welcome to subscribe to the security@ovirt.org mailing list. Your subscription will only be approved if you can demonstrate that you will handle issues in confidence and properly credit reporters as noted above. A second mailing list exists for discussion of embargoed security issues:

security-private@ovirt.org

You will be invited to subscribe to this list if you are subscribed to security@ovirt.org.
