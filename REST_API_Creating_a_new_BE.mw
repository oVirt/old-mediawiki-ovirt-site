= REST API - Adding a new BE =
In this wiki we will introduce all the steps needed in the REST API side in order to add a new Business Entity<br>
Examples on each step are based on work done in  [http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/16159 patch] for the Extrenal Tasks [http://www.ovirt.org/Features/ExternalTasks RFE]

== Creating BE in api.xsd ==
First, we will have do define the new BE in the api.xsd<br>
This is a XML meta-data file that helps to generate the new BE classes.<br>
In the example we will see a new ''Job'' entity and a new "Step" entity<br>
There is an heirarchy between "Job" and "Step" , A "Job" can contain several tests.<br>
Also, keep in mind that steps can be nested, we will get to that later.
