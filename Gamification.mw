'''Basic concepts'''
* achievement is the basic unit of tracking user's progress
* each achievement maps to one or more feature(s)
* achievements are organized into different categories (Networking, Storage, etc.)
* achievement can be in following states:
** locked - achievement not completed yet, show mini-guide (hint) on how to unlock it
** unlocked - achievement completed, show mini-doc with summary on feature(s) behind it
** blocked - completion of this achivement depends on completion of another achievement


'''Tracking progress'''
* each achievement has one or more completion condition(s) - tracking progress of given achievement
* progress = % of achievements unlocked in given category (category progress) or in total (global progress)
* rank = textual representation of progress (Novice, Master, etc.)


'''Advanced concepts'''
