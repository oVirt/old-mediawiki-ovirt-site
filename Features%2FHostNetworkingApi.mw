== Current Status ==
The current host networking api (up to ovirt-engine-3.6) suffers from various limitations:
* A mix of the physical and the logical network configuration
** Exposing vlan device implementation to the user
** Using 'Sync Network' feature requires to find the specific interface which carries the network
* A Cumbersome request format for 'setup networks':
** creating vlan devices
** a complex input structure to represent the expected configuration
* The attach/detach network isn't the RESTFul way to modify the interface
* Cannot support a host only network (a network without a nic)
** Cannot support a dynamic (external) networks

== Proposed Solution ==
Introduce '''<network_connection>''' element which describes how the network is configured on the host:
  <network_connection>
    <network/>
    <host_nic/>
    <ip_configuration/>
    <properties/>
    <qos/>
    <override_configuration/>
    <reported_configurations in_sync="false">
      <reported_configuration name="mtu" value="9000" in_sync="false" />
      <reported_configuration name="bridged" value="false" in_sync="false" />
      <reported_configuration name="vlan" value="200" in_sync="false" />
    </reported_configurations>
  </network_connection>
* network - which logical network is connected to the host
* host_nic - an optional sub-element which described the underlying interface
** When not provided, implies the network is a nic-less network
** Can specify an unused nic or a bond (either existing bond or bond to create requires unused nics).
* ip_configuration - the ip configuration (ipv4/ipv6, boot protocol and addresses)
* properties - network custom properties
* override_configuration - sync network on host according to its logical network definition
* reported_configuration - read-only element, returned ''only'' when the network is out-of-sync with the logical network definition, listing the specific out-of-sync properties.

The '''ip_configuration''' representation is: 
  <ip_configuration>
    <ipv4s>
      <boot_protocol>DHCP</boot_protocol> 
      <ipv4 primary="true">
        <address />
        <netmask /> <!-- can be prefix -->
        <gateway />
      </ipv4>
      <ipv4>
        <address />
        <netmask />
        <gateway /> 
      <ipv4>
    </ipv4s>
    <ipv6s>
      <boot_protocol>DHCP</boot_protocol>
      <ipv6>
        <address /> <!-- netmask is part of the address -->
        <gateway />
      </ipv6>
      <ipv6>
        <address />
        <gateway />
      </ipv6>
    </ipv6s>
  </ip_configuration>

==== Network connections sub-collection of the nic resource ====
* A collection of network connections that are attached to a specific physical interface or a bond:
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkconnections
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a list of networks attached to the nic
**# '''POST''' attaches a network to the nic

==== Setupnetworks API of the host resource ====
* A multi-network configuration action to support complex network settings (i.e. cross nics actions: move network from one nic to another or create network on bond)
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/setupnetworks
* Supported actions:
** '''POST''' - expects a relative change to be applied on the host, using ''PATCH'' behaviour.
* Request structure:
  <action>
    <bonds />
    <removed_bonds />    
    <network_connections />
    <removed_network_connections />
    <check_connectivity />
    <connectivity_timeout />
  </action>
* bonds - describes bonds to create or to update, those bonds could be referred by name from the network_connection element
* removed_bonds - list of bonds to remove
* network_connections - describes which networks should be configured (add or update) on the host. 
** When host nic is provided, the network will be configured on it
** When host nic is omitted, the network will be configured as a nicless network
** When a nic is changed, the network will be reconfigured on the new nic (move network from nic to nic).
* removed_network_connections - list networks to remove

==== Network connection resource under nic ====
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkconnections/{networkconnection:id}
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a specific network which is attached to the nic
**# '''DELETE''' detaches a network from the nic
**# '''PUT''' updates the network on the nic

==== Network statistics sub-collection (optional) ====
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkconnections/{networkconnections:id}/statistics
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a specific statistics for a network (if reported) which is attached to the nic

* We can implement a new API in this context to reflect the total rx/tx instead of a processed measurements.

== Current Host Networking API (up to ovirt-engine-3.5) ==
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics
* '''GET''' - list of network interfaces (GetVdsInterfacesByVdsId)
* '''POST''' - creates a bond (AddBond)

  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/setupnetworks
* '''POST''' - performs setup networks action (SetupNetworks)

  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}
* '''GET''' - gets a specific network interface (GetVdsInterfacesByVdsId)
* '''DELETE''' - removes a bond (RemoveBond)
* '''PUT''' - updates a network which is attached to the specific network interface, aka mini-setup networks (UpdateNetworkToVdsInterface)

  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/attach
* '''POST''' - adds a network to a nic (AttachNetworkToVdsInterface)

  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/detach
* '''POST''' - removes a network from a nic (DetachNetworkFromVdsInterface)

  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/statistics
* '''GET''' - list the statistics of the specific network interface

Network labels related actions are listed at [[Features/NetworkLabels#REST]].<br>

== What should be deprecated? ==
* The ''network'' element in host_nic is replaced by ''networkconnections'' subcollection:
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}:
  <host_nic>
    <network />
  </host_nic>

  is replaced by:
  <host_nic>
    <link href= "/ovirt-engine/api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkconnections" rel="networkconnections"/>
  </host_nic>

The vlan devices will be hidden from the list of /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics and will be represented as a ''networkconnection'' element of the underlying nic.

* Deprecated: /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/setupnetworks
  <host_nics>
    <host_nic>
      <network id="..."/>
    </host_nic>
  </host_nics>

Is replaced by: /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/setupnics
  <host_nics>
    <host_nic>
      <networkconnections>
       ...
      </networkconnections>
    </host_nic>
    ...
  </host_nics>

Request should contain only nics or bonds (no vlans).

* Deprecated Host nics actions:
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/attach
  is replaced by POST request to 
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkconnections
and:
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/detach
  is replaced by DELETE request to:
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkconnections/{networkconnection:id}

* Updating network interface
  '''PUT''' on /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/
  the action semantics is changed to edit bond only
