{{Feature|name=Host Networking API|modules=Networking|version=oVirt 3.6|status=Design|}}

=== Owner ===
* Name: [[User:masayag| Moti Asayag]]
* Email: masayag@redhat.com

== Current Status ==
The current host networking api (up to ovirt-engine-3.6) suffers from various limitations:
* A mix of the physical and the logical network configuration
** Exposing vlan device implementation to the user
** Using 'Sync Network' feature requires to find the specific interface which carries the network
* A Cumbersome request format for 'setup networks':
** creating vlan devices
** a complex input structure to represent the expected configuration
* The attach/detach network isn't the RESTFul way to modify the interface
* Cannot support a host only network (a network without a nic)
** Cannot support a dynamic (external) networks

== Proposed Solution ==
Introducing new sub-collections to reflect the host network configuration:

=== Network connections sub-collection of the nic resource ===
* A collection of network connections that are attached to a specific physical interface or a bond:
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkconnections
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a list of networks attached to the nic
**# '''POST''' attaches a network to the nic

==== Network resource ====
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkconnections/{networkconnection:id}
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a specific network which is attached to the nic
**# '''DELETE''' detaches a network from the nic
**# '''PUT''' updates the network on the nic

==== Network statistics sub-collection ====
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkconnections/{networkconnections:id}/statistics
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a specific statistics for a network (if reported) which is attached to the nic

==== Network connections sub-collection ====
* A collection of network connections which represent how the network is provisioned on the host
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networkconnections
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a list of networks configured on the host
**# '''POST''' provision a network on the host

The '''<networkconnection>''' element describes the how network is configured on the host:
  <networkconnection>
    <network/>
    <host_nic/>
    <boot_protocol/>
    <ip/>
    <properties/>
    <qos/>
    <override_configuration/>
    <external/>
  </networkconnection>
* network - which logical network is connected to the host
* host_nic - an optional sub-element which described the underlying interface
** When not provided, implies the network is a nic-less network
** Can specify an unused nic or a bond (either existing bond or bond to create requires unused nics).
* external - a flag to indicate whether this network is managed by ovirt/vdsm
* boot_protocol - the boot protocol
* ip - ip address, subnet, gateway
* properties - network custom properties
* qos - the network qos
* override_configuration - sync network on host according to its logical network definition

==== Network connecton resource ====
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networkconnections/{networkconnection:id}
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a specific network configured on the host
**# '''PUT''' update a network configured on the host
**# '''DELETE''' removes a network from the host

==== Network connecton statistics sub-collection ====
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networkconnections/{networkconnection:id}/statistics
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a specific statistics for a network (if reported) which is attached to the host

==== Host Network Label resource ====
A collection designed to specify network labels on host level which aren't bounded to a specific nic.<br>
Using this resource, nic-less networks could be configured on host.
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networklabels/
* '''GET''' - list host network labels
* '''POST''' - add a label to the host

  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networklabels/{networklabel:id}
* '''GET''' - returns a specific host network label
* '''DELETE''' - removes a specific host network label

'''pros''': Using host level network labels we can support nic-less networks auto-provision<br>
'''cons''': The management of labels becomes more complex, cannot use same label for nics<br>


== Current Host Networking API (up to ovirt-engine-3.5) ==
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics
* '''GET''' - list of network interfaces (GetVdsInterfacesByVdsId)
* '''POST''' - creates a bond (AddBond)

  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/setupnetworks
* '''POST''' - performs setup networks action (SetupNetworks)

  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}
* '''GET''' - gets a specific network interface (GetVdsInterfacesByVdsId)
* '''DELETE''' - removes a bond (RemoveBond)
* '''PUT''' - updates a network which is attached to the specific network interface, aka mini-setup networks (UpdateNetworkToVdsInterface)

  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/attach
* '''POST''' - adds a network to a nic (AttachNetworkToVdsInterface)

  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/detach
* '''POST''' - removes a network from a nic (DetachNetworkFromVdsInterface)

  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/statistics
* '''GET''' - list the statistics of the specific network interface

Network labels related actions are listed at [[Features/NetworkLabels#REST]].<br>

== What should be deprecated? ==
* The ''network'' element in host_nic is replaced by ''networkconnections'' subcollection:
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}:
  <host_nic>
    <network />
  </host_nic>

  is replaced by:
  <host_nic>
    <link href= "/ovirt-engine/api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkconnections" rel="networkconnections"/>
  </host_nic>

The vlan devices will be hidden from the list of /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics and will be represented as a ''networkconnection'' element of the underlying nic.

* Deprecated: /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/setupnetworks
  <host_nics>
    <host_nic>
      <network id="..."/>
    </host_nic>
  </host_nics>

Is replaced by: /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/setupnics
  <host_nics>
    <host_nic>
      <networkconnections>
       ...
      </networkconnections>
    </host_nic>
    ...
  </host_nics>

Request should contain only nics or bonds (no vlans).

* Deprecated Host nics actions:
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/attach
  is replaced by POST request to 
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkconnections
and:
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/detach
  is replaced by DELETE request to:
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networkconnections/{networkconnection:id}

* Updating network interface
  '''PUT''' on /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/
  the action semantics is changed to edit bond only

== Samples ==
Request samples can be found [[Features/NetworkingApi|here]].

== Detailed Design ==
A new entity named NetworkConnection will be added to the system. The NetworkConnection will represent a network which is configured on a host.<br>
The NetworkConnection can be attached to a network interface or not. If not attached to a network interface, the network is considered a nic-less network.
A new table '''network_connections''' will be added :

<span style="color:Teal">'''NETWORK_CONNECTIONS'''</span> Describes a network configured on a host:<BR>
{|class="wikitable sortable"
!border="1"| Column Name ||Column Type ||Null? / Default ||Definition 
|-
|id ||UUID ||not null ||The network connection ID 
|-
|network_id ||UUID ||not null ||The configured network ID
|-
|external ||Boolean ||not null ||Indicates if the network is external
|-
|nic_id ||UUID ||null ||The network interface id on which the network is configured (nic or bond)
|-
|boot_protocol ||String ||null ||The network boot protocol
|-
|ip_address ||String ||null ||The desired network ip address
|-
|netmask ||String ||null ||The desired network netmask
|-
|gateway ||String ||null ||The desired network gateway
|-
|properties ||Text ||null ||The desired network properties
|-
|}

The table will allow to differentiate between the desired network configuration to what is actually configured on the host.<br>
By that the engine will have a better capability to report more cases of network out-of-sync.<br>

=== Backend Changes ===
==== New commands ====
'''AddNetworkConnectionCommand''' - adds a network connection to a host<br>
'''UpdateNetworkConnectionCommand''' - updates network connection on a host<br>
'''RemoveNetworkConnectionCommand''' - removes a network connection from the host<br>
'''GetNetworkConnectionByIdQuery''' - returns network connection by its id<br>
'''GetNetworkConnectionsByNicIdQuery''' - returns all network connections which are configured on top of a given nic<br>
'''GetNetworkConnectionsByHostIdQuery''' - returns all network connections which are configured on top of a given host<br>
'''SetupNicsCommand''' - performs multiple network connections changes on a host at once<br>
==== Updated commands ====
'''SetupNetworksCommand''' - In case 'checkConnnectivity' is set, compensation for network connections should be triggered in case of a failure. If 'checkConnnectivity' is unset, no compensation is required for network connections.
