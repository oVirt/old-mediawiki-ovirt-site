= Host Networking API =

== Current Status ==
The current host networking api suffers from various limitations:
* A mix of the physical and the logical network configuration
** Exposing vlan device implementation to the user
* A Cumbersome request format for 'setup networks':
** creating vlan devices
** a complex input structure to represent the expected configuration
* The attach/detach network isn't the RESTFul way to modify the interface
* Cannot support a host only network (a network without a nic)
** Cannot support a dynamic (external) networks

== Proposed Solution ==
Introducing new sub-collections to reflect the host network configuration
