= Host Networking API =

== Current Status ==
The current host networking api suffers from various limitations:
* A mix of the physical and the logical network configuration
** Exposing vlan device implementation to the user
* A Cumbersome request format for 'setup networks':
** creating vlan devices
** a complex input structure to represent the expected configuration
* The attach/detach network isn't the RESTFul way to modify the interface
* Cannot support a host only network (a network without a nic)
** Cannot support a dynamic (external) networks

== Proposed Solution ==
Introducing new sub-collections to reflect the host network configuration:

=== Network sub-collection of the nic resource ===
* A collection of networks that are attached to a specific physical interface or a bond:
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networks
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a list of networks attached to the nic
**# '''POST''' attaches a network to the nic

==== Network resource ====
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networks/{network:id}
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a specific network which is attached to the nic
**# '''DELETE''' detaches a network from the nic

==== Network statistics sub-collection ====
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/nics/{nic:id}/networks/{network:id}/statistics
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a specific statistics for a network (if reported) which is attached to the nic

==== Network connectons sub-collection ====
* A collection of network connections which represent how the network is provisioned on the host
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networkconnections
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a list of networks configured on the host
**# '''POST''' provision a network on the host

==== Network connecton resource ====
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networkconnections/{networkconnection:id}
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a specific network configured on the host
**# '''PUT''' update a network configured on the host
**# '''DELETE''' removes a network from the host

==== Network connecton statistics sub-collection ====
  /api/hosts/{host:id}/networkconnections/{networkconnection:id}/statistics
* Supported actions:
**# '''GET''' returns a specific statistics for a network (if reported) which is attached to the host
