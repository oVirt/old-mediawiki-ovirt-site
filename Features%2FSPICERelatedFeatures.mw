=== Current status ===
* In design phase
* Last updated date: February 6th, 2012.


=== Detailed Description ===
In the upcoming version, SPICE is about to perform the following changes/additions:
#New SPICE client: virt-viewer
#Native USB support
#*This option will only be supported in the virt-viewer client
#Change multiple monitor support on RHEL and Fedora
#* Instead of supporting multiple monitor support by adding several display devices, it will be done using one device, with a number of available monitors
#WAN support - there are several protocol options that are useful when connecting using SPICE via WAN (compression options, display options, etc.)


=== Implementation Details ===
#Change multiple monitor support on RHEL
#* UserPortal changes
#** Enable using multiple monitors on RHEL (it is disabled today)
#*VDSM changes
#**Pass libvirt the number of monitors using the "heads" property in the display device on the libvirt domain.xml file
#*Engine-core changes
#**Support the use of multiple monitors on a single device only in cluster level 3.1+. Lower cluster levels will use multiple devices.
#*UserPortal/webadmin changes
#**Allow setting multiple monitors to RHEL guests
#WAN Support
#* In the protocol options in the User Portal, we should add the following options:
#**Network mode:
#***auto-detect (default)
#***LAN
#***WAN
#**Compression mode:
#*** loci or not

==== virt-viewer support ====

At first phase, both SPICEC and the virt-viewer will work side by side.
Some features, such as native USB support, will only be supported when using the new virt-viewer client.
So, in order to support working with both clients side by side, working with the client that we need in order to get the required capabilities, we need to do the following:
* In the UserPortal, identify which clients are installed
* For each client
** Get the client version
** Get the client capabilities (start with Native USB support, non-native USB support, WAN support, but in the future we might have more capabilities)
* Work with either SPICEC and virt-viewer, per-VM:
** If virt-viewer is installed, work with it by default, unless there is a need to get non-native USB support (will only happen in cluster level lower than 3.1)
** If non-native USB support is needed, and SPICEC is not installed (or it is installed, but the non-native USB support components aren't installed), give the user a proper error message
** If the cluster level is 3.1 (which supports native USB support), but the client only has non-native USB support (old client), then we will use the old client. This means that we'll have to keep supporting the non-native USB support, side-by-side with the native one.
* Show the protocol options according to the client type - now the only change is that the WAN options should be displayed only when working with virt-viewer

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Integrating with new SPICE capabilities will ease the user work in the oVirt environment.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
# Fully functional and supported virt-viewer
# The ability to work with native and non-native USB support in the same guest (to support both virt-viewer and SPICEC for connecting to the same VM)


=== Comments and Discussion ===
Issues/Questions:
#USB support - today it is only on desktops. Should it be supported on servers as well?
#Today we have all the API needed to pass the number of monitors. Are there any other flags needed for that feature (like amount of memory per-monitor)? If so, we will need to extend the API to support that.
#*Today this logic is done in the VDSM level. It would be best if we could leave the logic there, changing it accordingly.
#Installation/Packaging - will we package and install virt-viewer, or will it be installed separately by the user?

Future Work:
#Support server-side USB filtering.
#Persisting the protocol options per VM.
