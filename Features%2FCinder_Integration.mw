== Summary == 
OpenStack Cinder(/ceph) Integration

== Detailed Description ==
Managing OpenStack Cinder volumes provisioned by ceph storage through oVirt engine.
For initial phase, the integration should ensure support for creating/deleting volumes
from a Cinder storage domain, while monitoring relevant statuses using [[CommandCoordinator|CoCo]] mechanism.
The engine/vdsm should allow running VMs with attached ceph volumes via librbd library using libvirt support ([http://ceph.com/docs/master/rbd/libvirt/ using libvirt with ceph rbd]).
As for security, when required, running VMs can authenticate using [http://ceph.com/docs/v0.69/rados/operations/auth-intro/ CEPHX] protocol (secret management will be handled in engine/vdsm).

== Dependencies / Related Features ==
* [[https://github.com/woorea/openstack-java-sdk woorea]] openstack-java-sdk should be updated and expanded to include cinder-model/cinder-client modules (needed for having an interface to interact with cinder rest-api commands.

== Phases ==
* CRUD for OpenStack Volume (Cinder) provider.
* CRUD for adding/deleting Cinder disks (including monitoring).
* CRUD for snapshots with Cinder disks.
* Fetching Volume Types - ceph/lvm/etc.
* Running VMs with Cinder disks attached.
* CEPHX integration for using volumes securely.
* Import (from Cinder to engine DB).
* Permissions (MLA).
* Templates
** Add template - clone volume/create volume from snapshot - use [http://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/add-cloning-support-to-cinder clone volume] and [https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/add-flat-volume-api flat volume] (if available).
** Add VM from template - create volume from source volume (thin).

== Future Work? ==
* Move VM disk/Copy Template disk (cinder-to-cinder?/cinder-to-vdsm?/vdsm-to-cinder?).
* Retype volume [https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/volume-retype volume-retype] (not supported for rbd yet).
* Upload to Image (glance).
* CRUD for volume types.
* Quota (Cinder/Engine).
* Import/Export (VMs/Templates).
* Disk profiles.
* Live snapshots.
* Sync Cinder data with engine DB.
* Cinder storage domain monitoring.

== Relevant Flows ==
* Add/Remove/Update/Extend Cinder Disk
* Remove VM
* Add Template
* Remove Template
* Add VM from Template
* Add VM Pool
* Attach Cinder Disks
* Plug/Unplug (Cold/Hot)
* List Cinder Disks
* Register Cinder Disks
* Run VM - [multiple ceph monitors support / Cephx auth (secrets)]
* Add/Remove Snapshot
* Preview/Undo/Commit Snapshot
* Custom Preview Snapshot
* Clone VM from Snapshot
* Clone VM

== Open Issues ==
* Verify limits/quota against Cinder on Disk creation.
* VM removal - deleted disks remain in 'locked' status (as opposed to images which are deleted immediately). I.e. failure would caused to disks in status 'illegal'.

=== Flow Illustration ===
[[File:cinder_flow_illustration.png]]

=== Engine ===

=== VDSM ===
* Add [https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/librbd1 librbd1 package] as dependency to vdsm.spec file.
* Refactor 'Dirve -> getXML()' to support multiple hosts (represents Ceph monitors) in disk's source element:
 <disk type='network' device='disk'>
        <source protocol='rbd' name='libvirt-pool/new-libvirt-image'>
                <host name='{monitor-host}' port='6789'/>
                ...
        </source>
        <target dev='vda' bus='virtio'/>
 </disk>
* [TBD] [http://ceph.com/docs/v0.69/rados/operations/auth-intro/ CEPHX] secret handling - [http://ceph.com/docs/master/rbd/libvirt/#configuring-the-vm Libvirt with CEPH (Configuring the VM section)].
