== Nightly Builds ==
Nightly builds are available from  oVirt snapshots repositories:
 http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-master-snapshot-static/
 http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-master-snapshot/

Please refer to [[Install nightly snapshot]] guide for enabling those repositories

== oVirt Live ==
oVirt Live has been rebased on EL7.

Please help us testing it! Latest nightly iso is available here:  http://jenkins.ovirt.org/job/ovirt_live_create_iso/

== Features Status Table ==
To try and improve 3.6 planning over the wiki approach in 3.3,  this google doc http://goo.gl/9X3G49 has been created.

== Translation Status ==
Translations are handled by Zanata. You can join the translators team and see current translation status here:<br>
https://translate.zanata.org/zanata/iteration/view/ovirt/master/languages

== Key Proposed Changes ==
The following list is a subset of the [http://www.ovirt.org/Category:OVirt_3.6_Proposed_Feature features proposed for oVirt 3.6]
* [[Features/Management Network As A Role]]
* [[Features/DetailedHostNetworkingApi]]
* [[Features/HostNetworkingApi]]
* [[Features/IsolatedNetworks]]
* [[Features/Cluster parameters override]]
* Drop support for Fedora <=  20
* [[Features/Fedora 22 Support | Add support for Fedora 22]]
* [[Features/Debian_support_for_hosts | Add support for Ubuntu hosts]]
* No support for new features on el6. el6 hosts would be allowed only in [http://lists.ovirt.org/pipermail/users/2014-September/027421.html 3.5 compatibility mode].
* Hosted Engine support only on hosts supporting 3.6 compatibility level (EL7 and Fedora). A guide will be provided for migrating from EL6

== Tracker Bug ==
* {{BZ|1155425}} - Tracker: oVirt 3.6 release

== Release Criteria ==
=== Alpha Release Criteria ===
# MUST: All sources must be available on ovirt.org
# MUST: All packages listed by subprojects must be available in the repository

=== Beta Release Criteria ===
# MUST: Release Notes have feature-specific information: [[oVirt 3.6 Release Notes]]
# MUST: Alpha Release Criteria are met
# MUST: Supported localizations must be at least at 70% of completeness for being included in the release
# MUST: All accepted features must be substantially complete and in a testable state and enabled by default -- if so specified by the change

=== Candidate Release Criteria ===
# MUST: Beta Release Criteria are met
# MUST: All test cases defined for each accepted feature must be verified and pass the test for the build to be released
# MUST: All lower-level components must be available on supported distributions at required version [1]
# MUST: No known regressions from previous releases should be present
# MUST: Each subproject must allow upgrade from a previous version, either providing documented manuals or automated upgrade procedures
# MUST: All features working on previous release must still work in the new release if not dropped as deprecated

[1] This means we're not hosting any package we don't develop inside oVirt repository just because it's not yet released officially.
