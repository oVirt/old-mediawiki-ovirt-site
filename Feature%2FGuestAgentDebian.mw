=== Testing ===
<!-- Explain how this feature may be tested by a user or a quality engineer. List relevant use cases and expected results. -->
Testing has to be executed on a Debian 7 system. Lower version do not fulfil the minimal requirements for the guest agent and testing/unstable are currently not supported by us.

==== Verification ====
* Follow the installation instructions above to install the guest agent
* After about 15-30 seconds the Web Admin Portal entry for the VM should show:
** the IPv4 Addresses of the VM  in the grid
** the FQDN of the VM in the grid
** kernel package and the ovirt-guest-agent-common package in the application list
** The FQDN in the general tab
** Logged-in User: in the Sessions tab should be filled if a user is logged in.
** All IPs (IPv4 and IPv6) in the Network Interfaces tab in the Guest Agent Data section for each interface. 
* Verification via on the VDSM side: `vdsClient -s 0 getVmStats <VM UUID>`
** Reported fields are non-empty:
*** guestFQDN
*** netIfaces
*** disksUsage
*** memoryStats
*** guestName
*** appsList
*** guestOs
*** username
*** guestIPs (if there are IPv4 addresses)

'''Note:''' The VM UUID can be found on the Admin Portal in the General tab for the VM
'''Note:''' The FQDN value is only only shown if the FQDN is not empty, not localhost and not localhost.localdomain
