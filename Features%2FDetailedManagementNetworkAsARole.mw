{{Feature|name=Management network as a role - Detailed|modules=Networking|version=oVirt 3.6|status=WIP|}}
<!-- {{autolang|base=yes}} -->

= Summary =
This page describes the implementation details of the [[Features/Management_Network_As_A_Role|"Management network as a role" feature]].

== Entity Description ==
* No new entities
* ''Management'' boolean field will be added to NetworkCluster entity. ''True'' value will indicate that the network is the management one in the given cluster (similarly like it been done for display networks).

= Installation/Upgrade =
* During the upgrade the new field (''is_management'') will be added to ''NETWORK_CLUSTER'' table and will be populated by ''true'' value for ovirtmgmt networks and ''false'' for all other networks.
* The following DB objects will be updated with the new field:
** ''NETWORK_CLUSTER_VIEW''
** Stored procedures:
*** ''GetAllNetworkByClusterId''
*** ''Insertnetwork_cluster''
*** ''Updatenetwork_cluster''
* New stored procedure ''set_network_exclusively_as_management'' will be created

= Planned code changes =

== UI ==
The UI layer will be updated according to the [[Features/Management_Network_As_A_Role|feature page]]. 

All places that refer to ''ConfigurationValues.ManagementNetwork'' value will be updated with the new logic.

More details to come...

== Backend ==
=== ManagementNetworkFinder ===
''ManagementNetworkFinder'' class will be introduced. The class will implement heuristic logic of finding the management network either it was supplied by the user or not.

=== AddVdsGroupCommand  ===
In addition to what it already does the class will determine what management network should be (using ''ManagementNetworkFinder'') and will:
* attach it to the new cluster
* make it management and required

=== UpdateVdsGroupCommand ===
In the case when the management network is to be updated:
==== canDoAction ====
The following checks will be added:
* the new management network is required
* no hosts are attached to the cluster 
==== executeCommand ====
Same as AddVdsGroupCommand

=== NetworkUtils ===
''isManagementNetwork'' methods will be moved to a new ''ManagementNetworkUtils'' class that will reside in ''bll'' project. 
The new class will implement the following methods:
* boolean isManagementNetwork(Guid networkId)
* boolean isManagementNetwork(String networkName, Guid clusterId)
* Network getManagementNetwork(Guid clusterId)

=== DAO ===
Optionally: a new ''getManagementNetwork'' method will be added to ''NetworkClusterDao''

=== Command classes ===
The following classes will be affected by the feature:
* org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.InstallVdsInternalCommand
* org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.UpdateVdsGroupCommand
* org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.VdsDeploy
* org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.NetworkConfigurator
* org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.cluster.UpdateNetworkOnClusterCommand
* org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.dc.UpdateNetworkCommand
* org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.host.AttachNetworkToVdsInterfaceCommand
* org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.host.UpdateNetworkToVdsInterfaceCommand
* org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.host.SetupNetworksHelper
* org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.RemoveNetworkParametersBuilder
* org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.cluster.AttachNetworkToVdsGroupCommand
* org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.cluster.UpdateNetworkOnClusterCommand
* org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.network.host.AddBondCommand
* org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.storage.UpdateStoragePoolCommand
* org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.validator.NetworkValidator
* org.ovirt.engine.core.vdsbroker.vdsbroker.CollectVdsNetworkDataVDSCommand
* org.ovirt.engine.core.vdsbroker.vdsbroker.SetupNetworksVDSCommand

= Events =
<!-- What events should be reported when using this feature. -->
According to the new validations.

= Open Issues =
# ManagementNetworkUtils project - the right place for that kind of logic is ''bll''. However, the logic is needed by ''vdsbroker'', but  ''bll'' is dependent on the earlier apparently. ðŸ˜ 
# UpdateVdsGroupCommand - when moving the cluster back into a DC, need to add its management network.
** Which network should be assigned as the management one?
** What should be done with the host of the cluster?
