This page tries to grab some of the properties we like about Node and which makes it what it is.

== Flows and Terms ==

Thsi section actually tries to divide the whole Node concept into distinct sections.

    (Build time)    Packageset -> Rootfs compose -> LiveCD creation
    (Runtime)                                       LiveCD -> Installation -> Runtime layout

* package set: The package set defines what packages are contained in the the rootfs
* rootfs compose: The rootfs is composed by some kind of tool (imgfac, yum, rpm, rpm-ostree)
* LiveCD creation: Another tool creates the LiveCD, currently only livemedia-creator is avaialble, which either takes a package set or rootfs
* Installation: An installer on the LiveCD can be used to install the rootfs to a host
* runtime layout: The runtime is the rootfs on the host which hosts VMs

== Delivery ==
The ISO (kernel+initrd) which is used to deliver the OS to the host.

* Size: Small
* Image: ISO Image
* Media
** USB
** PXE

== Payload ==
The actual rootfs which is used at runtime.

* Size: Small
* Image: Deployment image (ISO)

=== Installation ===
* iSCSI, EFI, multipath
* Partitioning
* Bootloader
* Image transfer

=== Upgrade + Rollback ===
* "Atomic" single image
* Rollback into previous image (boot into different LV)

=== Security ===
* SELinux
* Read-Only rootfs (because of squashfs)

== Implementation ==
* Livecd (current)

* Possible alternatives
** Fedora Atomic - ostree based / image like
** Anaconda derived - package based

== Problems ==
* Bind mounts are limited
* Early-boot-process changes are not possible
* Live plugins are hard
* Installation is custom
