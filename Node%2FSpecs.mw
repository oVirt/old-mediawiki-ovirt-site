This page tries to grab some of the properties we like about Node and which makes it what it is.

== Flows and Terms ==

Thsi section actually tries to divide the whole Node concept into distinct sections.

    (Build time)    Packageset -> Rootfs compose -> LiveCD creation
    (Runtime)                                       LiveCD -> Installation -> Runtime layout

* package set: The package set defines what packages are contained in the the rootfs
* rootfs compose: The rootfs is composed by some kind of tool (imgfac, yum, rpm, rpm-ostree)
* LiveCD creation: Another tool creates the LiveCD, currently only livemedia-creator is avaialble, which either takes a package set or rootfs
* Installation: An installer on the LiveCD can be used to install the rootfs to a host
* runtime layout: The runtime is the rootfs on the host which hosts VMs

== Delivery ==
The ISO (kernel+initrd) which is used to deliver the OS to the host.

* Size: Small
* Image: ISO Image
* Media
** USB
** PXE

== Payload ==
The actual rootfs which is used at runtime.

* Size: Small
* Image: Deployment image (ISO)

=== Installation ===
* iSCSI, EFI, multipath
* Partitioning
* Bootloader
* Image transfer

=== Upgrade + Rollback ===
* "Atomic" single image
* Rollback into previous image (boot into different LV)

=== Security ===
* SELinux
* Read-Only rootfs (because of squashfs)

== Implementation ==
* Livecd (current)

* Possible alternatives
** Fedora Atomic - ostree based / image like
** Anaconda derived - package based

== Problems ==
* Bind mounts are limited
* Early-boot-process changes are not possible
* Live plugins are hard
* Installation is custom

| '''Build time'''

|-
| ''Build tool''
| koji / livecd-tools
| [http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2014/04/build-your-own-atomic-host-on-fedora-20/ ostree-builder]
| koji / lorax (livemedia-creator) or imgfac

|-
| ''Image specification''
| kickstart (recipe)
| kickstart (for installation) and <code>product.json</code> for tree
| kickstart (for installation) and kickstart (for tree compose)

|-
| '''Delivery'''

|-
| ''Installation Media''
| LiveCD
| LiveCD
| LiveCD

|-
| ''Upgrade delivery''
| LiveCD in RPM
| ostree in RPM or with "Atomic Manager"
| LiveCD in RPM or yum

|-
| '''Installation and Upgrade'''

|-
| ''Installer''
| custom (ovirt-node-installer)
| anaconda
| anaconda

|-
| ''Setup TUI''
| custom (ovirt-node-setup)
| custom (ovirt-node-setup)
| custom (ovirt-node-setup)

|-
| ''Upgrade''
| Image based / One main, one fallback LV
| Tree based/ Many (os)trees on a rootfs
| Image or package based / Many images in a VG or yum update

|-
| ''Rollback''
| Boot into other LV
| Boot into specific tree
| Boot into specific LV


|-
| '''Plugins'''

|-
| ''Plugin format''
| rpm
| rpm
| rpm

|-
| ''Runtime plugin installation''
| N/A
| N/A (currently)
| Using a package manager
'''Limitation: bootloader should be prevented to be upgraded'''

|-
| ''Offline plugin installation''
| Using edit-node, deploy new iso
| Add package to (os)tree, build on server side, deploy new tree
| Using new libguestfs (or wrapper around it)


|-
| '''Persistence'''

|-
| ''Data storage (for big files)''
| /data is mounted to a Data LV
| Writeable /var, mounted to another LV
| Basically the whole fs, but /var should also be mounted to a separate LV

|-
| ''Persistence (for individual/random files) between boots''
| Using writeable Config LV and bind-mounts into target

'''Limitation: I.e. kernel modules can not be persisted'''
| Writeable /etc

'''Limitation: I.e. kernel modules can not be persisted'''
| Writeable filesystem and/or Config LV

|-
| ''Persistence (for individual/random files) between upgrades''
| Using writeable Config LV and bind-mounts

'''Limitation: I.e. kernel modules can not be persisted'''
| Copying /etc from N to N+1 and upgrade tree could be modified

'''Limitation: I.e. kernel modules can only be persisted in modified tree'''
| Copying whitelisted/new/glob/* / files from N to N+1 (hook based mechanism)
