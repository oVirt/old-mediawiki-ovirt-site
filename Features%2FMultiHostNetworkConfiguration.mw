Edit Provisioned Networks

== Your Feature Name <!-- The name of your feature --> ==

=== Summary ===
The feature allows the administrator to modify a network (i.e. vlan-id, mtu) which is already provisioned by hosts and to apply the network changes to all of the hosts within the data-center to which the network is assigned.

=== Current status ===
* Planned for ovirt-engine-3.4
* Last updated: {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Having this feature simplifies significantly the maintenance of hosts within the system: <br>
It reduces the amount of actions required to reflect a logical network definition change by the administrator (a single 'Setup Network' action per host).<br>
In addition, the feature reduces the risk of having hosts network configuration not synchronized with the logical network definition.

=== Detailed Description ===
A new property 'apply' will be added to 'Update Network' command which triggers the hosts network configuration sync with the update network definition.<br>
The 'UpdateNetworkCommand' will be changed to a non-transactive. Its execution will be consisted of 2 steps:<br>
1. Updating the network logical definition on the DB and handles vnic profile accordingly (remove all if network changed to non-vm network).
2. Applying the network changes by executing a 'setup network' command for each host which the network is assigned to.

==== User Experience ====
A checkbox will be added to the 'Edit Network' dialog with caption 'Apply network change to all hosts'.<br>
The only supported properties to be apply on the hosts are: vlan, mtu, network type (vm/non-vm) and STP. <br>
Modifying the network name is permitted, but it will not be applied to hosts. Therefore attempt to modify network name and applying it to hosts will be blocked.<br>

We may consider as a lower priority to allow the user to specify the list of hosts on which to apply the changes instead of the entire hosts.

==== REST ====
Editing the network is done on rest via:
  api/networks/{network:id}
By providing the optional element apply:
  <network>
      <apply>true</apply>
  </network>

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
The feature is purely engine-side related. It doesn't depended on any other package.<br>
A reuse of a mass-operations on host should be consider for network labels.

=== Testing ===
1. To test the feature, a setup should include at least one host within the data-center having a network 'red' attached to on of its interfaces.
  * Edit the logical network definition of network 'red' (i.e. change vlan-id)
  * Mark the 'apply to all hosts' checkbox
  * Approve the command.
  * Verify network 'red' was modified correctly on the relevant data-center's hosts.
