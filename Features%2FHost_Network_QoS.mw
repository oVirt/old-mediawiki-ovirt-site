=Network traffic shaping=

=== Summary ===
In order to provide  traffic control for a network, we need to define  boundaries for incoming and outgoing traffic (Traffic Shaping - TS for simplicity).  This goal is achieved by defining inbound and outbound traffic (as defined in [[Features/Network_QoS#Detailed_Description Network QoS]])  for an host  network  by enabling TS when creating a new logical network or when editing a  previously associated logical network, i.e. an host network.

===Detailed description===
The admin /network admin is the only user who should be able to define Traffic Shaping.  TS defined in a logical network in the DC acts like a template, so any changes to the TS in the host network doesn't affect  the TS template in the logical network. If the user changes the TS definition in the Logical network this will not affect previously associated TS in the host network. The natural consequence is that logical network definition is not tied to the running network definition. The logical network TS definition is only copied over the running definition for the first time later on they are completely independent. In case an host with traffic shaping defined is moved over a different DC and for some reasons is marked as not operational (for example due to a different vlan id) before editing the network the running configuration should be synchronized to the logical one.

===Benefit to Ovirt===
Shaping network traffic is useful for network administrators, where they can provide a different class of service according
to the different kind of usages they need to satisfy. It might be also useful to limit the bandwidth of a [[Features/Migration_Network|migration network]] or in general
to every network who could possibly choke/saturate the overall interface bandwidth.

=User experience=

A user can define traffic shaping during creation of a logical network. Traffic shaping can be redefined when attaching a logical network to the physical host interfaces during a Setup Host Networks task (see images below):

[[File:new_lnetwork_bandwidth.png]]

Selecting the checkbox (Incoming/Outgoing or both) a user can shape the related kind of traffic using the needed parameters.
A user needs to specify all three parameters: average, burst and peak.

An icon should be associated with the network in Logical Networks list and the "Setup Host Networks" UI in order to  provide a visual feedback
for bandwidth shaped networks.

=Implementation=

==Backend / DB Change==
=Classes=
'''engine.core.common.businessentities.network.Network''' - 

=DB=
For the purpose we can reuse the network_qos table as defined in [[Features/Design/Network_QoS#DB_Change_2|Network QoS]]. Affected tables are the network table (logical network) and the vds_interface table (running host information). In particular we need to provide to both tables a reference to a definition of QoS available in the  network_qos table.

==Rest API==

TBD.

==VDSM==

Proposed [http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/15724/ vdsm api] allows to provide traffic shaping parameters as part of NetworkOptions or setupNetworkNetAttributes
used respectively by the addNetwork and setupNetworks verbs. In order to apply the configuration on the host network the Engine should convert
attributes' values from Mb to kb (Megabit to Kilobit). VDSM generates a similar libvirt xml definition.

   <network>				                          
     <name>vdsm-FinalAnswer</name>
     ...
     <bandwidth>
       <inbound average='30000' burst='200000'  peak='40000'/>
       <outbound average='30000' burst='200000'  peak='40000' />
     </bandwidth>
   </network>

Example vdscli:
<pre>
from vdsm import vdscli
connection = vdscli.connect()
connection.addNetwork('whatever', '', '', ['p1p4'], {'qosInbound':{'average': '10000', 'burst': '48000', 'peak':'12000' }})
</pre>
