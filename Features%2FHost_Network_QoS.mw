=Network traffic shaping=

=== Summary ===
In order to provide  control of  network traffic, we need to define traffic boundaries for incoming and outgoing traffic. 
This goal is achieved by associating a [[http://www.ovirt.org/Features/Network_QoS  Network QoS]]  to an abstract network entity.
Network QoS is used in the context of a Vnic Profile but it's relevant also for defining QoS for Networks having identical traffic shaping
attributes (average, burst and peak as detailed in [[http://www.ovirt.org/Features/Network_QoS  Network QoS]]).

===Detailed description===
During creation of a new logical network or when editing a logical network associated to a physical interface (Setup host networks),  the user (admin /network admin) should be able to select one of the available Network QoS in the DC or create a new Network QoS if the available ones don't satisfy his needs. 

Applying traffic shaping to a logical network doesn't involve any change in the DC hosts. Traffic shaping on a host network is applied when a logical network is associated with the host interface or when editing a previously shaped network.

===Benefit to Ovirt===
Shaping network traffic is useful for network administrators, where they can provide a different class of service according
to the different kind of usages they need to satisfy. It might be also useful to limit the bandwidth of a [[Features/Migration_Network|migration network]] or in general
to every network who could possibly choke/saturate the overall interface bandwidth.

=User experience=

A user can define traffic shaping during creation of a logical network. Traffic shaping can be redefined when attaching a logical network to the physical host interfaces during a Setup Host Networks task (see images below):

[[File:new_lnetwork_bandwidth.png]]

Selecting the checkbox (Incoming/Outgoing or both) a user can shape the related kind of traffic using the needed parameters.
A user needs to specify all three parameters: average, burst and peak.

[[File:edit_lnetwork_bandwidth.png]]

An icon should be associated with the network in Logical Networks list and the "Setup Host Networks" UI in order to  provide a visual feedback
for bandwidth shaped networks.

todo: replace network traffic limit label to host traffic limit - it might be misleading (2nd mockup).

=Implementation=

==Backend / DB Change==

We should reuse the entity NetworkQoS and network_qos database table as defined in [[http://www.ovirt.org/Features/Design/Network_QoS_-_detailed_design#Backend |Network QoS for Vnic]].

==Rest API==

TBD.

==VDSM==

Proposed [http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/15724/ vdsm api] allows to provide traffic shaping parameters as part of NetworkOptions or setupNetworkNetAttributes
used respectively by the addNetwork and setupNetworks verbs. In order to apply the configuration on the host network the Engine should convert
attributes' values from Mb to kb (Megabit to Kilobit). VDSM generates a similar libvirt xml definition.

   <network>				                          
     <name>vdsm-FinalAnswer</name>
     ...
     <bandwidth>
       <inbound average='30000' burst='200000'  peak='40000'/>
       <outbound average='30000' burst='200000'  peak='40000' />
     </bandwidth>
   </network>

Example vdscli:
<pre>
from vdsm import vdscli
connection = vdscli.connect()
connection.addNetwork('whatever', '', '', ['p1p4'], {'qosInbound':{'average': '10000', 'burst': '48000', 'peak':'12000' }})
</pre>
