=Network traffic shaping=

=== Summary ===
In order to provide better control of networks traffic, we need to define traffic boundaries for incoming and outgoing traffic. 
This goal is achieved by providing a general traffic shaping template which can be applied to an abstract network entity.
User can optionally redefine the traffic shaping template on a per host network basis.

===Detailed description===
[http://libvirt.org/formatnetwork.html Current implementation of libvirt]  allows shaping of  incoming (inbound) and outgoing (outbound) traffic in a network,
both types of traffic  can be shaped independently. Shaping a network traffic requires the definition of 3 attributes: 

*   Average: Average bit rate on the interface being shaped (Mbps).
*   Burst: Burst, amount of Mb that can be burst at peak speed (Mb).
*   Peak: Maximum rate at which interface can send data (Mbps).

For example defining a network "Students" with outbound traffic defined with average, burst and peak respectively  20, 200, 40
means that traffic will flow at 20 Mbps on average and the interface will be able to send a maximum of 200 Mb at the peak speed
of 40 Mbps, for the shaped network.

===Benefit to Ovirt===
Shaping network traffic is useful for network administrators, where they can provide a different class of service according
to the different kind of usages they need to satisfy. It might be also useful to limit the bandwidth of a [[Features/Migration_Network|migration network]] or in general
to every network who could possibly choke/saturate the overall interface bandwidth.

=User experience=

A user can define traffic shaping either during creation of a logical network or when editing a network's parameters during a Setup Host Networks task (see images below):

[[File:new_lnetwork_bandwidth.png]]

Selecting the checkbox (Incoming/Outgoing or both) a user can shape the related kind of traffic using the needed parameters.
A user needs to specify all three parameters: average, burst and peak.

A new role icon should be associated with the network in Logical Networks list and the "Setup Host Networks" UI in case it adopts traffic shaping.
