{{Feature|name=Self Hosted Engine FC Support|modules=ovirt-hosted-engine-setup|status=completed|version=3.6.0}}

== Summary ==
This feature enable the user to use FC storage for Hosted Engine data domain. 

== Owner ==
* Name: [[User:Stirabos| Simone Tiraboschi]]
* Email: <stirabos@redhat.com>

== Detailed Description ==

The FC storage HBA should be already configured and connected on the system. Multipath is supported.

==== UX changes ====
As usual launch hosted-engine --deploy:

Than you can find and additional valid answer to
          Please specify the storage you would like to use (iscsi, fc, nfs3, nfs4)[nfs3]: 
question.
Choose fc

It will scan the storage subsystem to find FC HBA letting you select a FC LUN to deploy the engine VM.

[ INFO  ] Connecting to the storage server
          The following luns have been found on the requested target:
          	[1]	330000000e5380848	56GiB	XtremIO	XtremApp
          		status: used, paths: 4 active
         
          	[2]	33000000022a29f57	100GiB	XtremIO	XtremApp
          		status: free, paths: 4 active

          Please select the destination LUN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) [1]: 

You can select one and proceed with engine VM setup.
That LUN will be used only for the engine VM and would not be available for other usages.

== Benefit to oVirt ==
Users will be able to use FC storage as data domain for Hosted Engine.

== Dependencies / Related Features ==
* A tracker bug has been created for tracking issues: {{BZ|1153278}}

== Documentation / External references ==

The engine VM image will be preallocated so the LUN should be sized to contain it, at least 5 additional GiB are needed for ancillary structures.
The LUN will be used only by the engine VM, no other usage are possible.

== Testing ==
On a FC capable HW try to deploy the engine VM over FC.

== Contingency Plan ==
Currently all the changes required for this feature are in a single patch. If it won't be ready it won't be merged.

== Release Notes ==
 ==Self Hosted Engine FC Support==
 Hosted Engine has now added support for [[Features/Self_Hosted_Engine_FC_Support|FC storage]]
