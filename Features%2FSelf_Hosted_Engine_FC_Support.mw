{{Feature|name=Self Hosted Engine FC Support|modules=ovirt-hosted-engine-setup|status=design|version=3.6.0}}

== Summary ==
This feature enable the user to use FC storage for Hosted Engine data domain. 

== Owner ==
* Name: [[User:Stirabos| Simone Tiraboschi]]
* Email: <stirabos@redhat.com>

== Detailed Description ==
==== UX changes ====
Using an existing FC storage:

tbd

==== Config files changes ====

tbd

==== VDSM commands involved ====
tbd

The rest is quite similar to NFS storage.

== Benefit to oVirt ==
Users will be able to use FC storage as data domain for Hosted Engine.

== Dependencies / Related Features ==
* A tracker bug has been created for tracking issues: {{BZ|1153278}}

== Documentation / External references ==

=== Development environment ===
The feature can be developed and tested in a simplified environment without the need of a real SAN using FCoE in VN2VN mode (FCoE Direct End-Node to End-Node) on a nested environment.

==== Prerequisites ====
Two virtual machine with two VirtIO network adapter for each node. The first one (eth0) will be used for generic network traffic, the second one (eth1) will be dedicated to FCoE.
The first virtual machine will be used to export a block device as a virtual SAN, the second one will connect to it and it will be used for hosted-engine.

On both the hosts, install the required FCoE utilities: 
 yum install lldpad fcoe-utils

===== virtIO issue ===== 
libhbalinux currently doesn't detect correctly a VirtIO interface cause it scans the system using sysfs to look for PCI adapter.
A recent patch [1] uses libudev instead of a direct scan of sysfs and so it than works also with VirtIO devices.
The patch hasn't still been merged and so it should manually be applied to libhbalinux  than   libhbalinux ,  libHBAAPI and  fcoe-utils should be rebuilt.
[1] http://lists.open-fcoe.org/pipermail/fcoe-devel/2014-October/012358.html
After that  fcoe-utils seams to correctly work also on VirtIO interfaces.

Activate eth1 interface, don't assign any ipadress to it
 ifconfig eth1 up

Create FCoE interface
 fcoeadm -m vn2vn -c eth1

Just being a test environment for development purposes DCB is not really needed so no really need to customize /etc/fcoe/cfg-eth1 and start lldpad.
