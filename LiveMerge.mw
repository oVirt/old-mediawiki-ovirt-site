=== Benefit to oVirt ===
This feature hides the complexity of the Live Merge flows behind a simple clickable "Delete" button in the UI.  This results in a symmetric create/delete snapshot operations regardless of whether the VM is running or not.  This feature has been actively requested by users.

=== Testing ===

==== Positive flow (Create and remove a snapshot while a VM runs) ====
* In webadmin, start a VM and create a new snapshot
* Navigate to the VM's disks and for each disk, select the snapshot that was created and click the Remove button
* After a few seconds, the snapshots should be removed from the list

==== Negative flow (engine restart during live merge) ====
* Start in webadmin with a running VM that has one or more snapshots
* Remove a snapshot as in the positive flow but immediately terminate ovirt-engine
* Wait for the operation to complete by using 'vdsClient getVolumeChain' on the virt host and watching for the volume to disappear
* Restart engine
* In webadmin, confirm that the snapshot is removed
* Check that the volume associated with the snapshot has been removed from storage

==== Negative flow (vdsm restart during live merge) ====
* Start in webadmin with a running VM that has one or more snapshots
* Remove a snapshot as in the positive flow but immediately terminate vdsm
* Wait for the host to go unresponsive in the webadmin
* Restart vdsm and wait for the host to return to Up status
* In webadmin, confirm that the snapshot is removed
* Check that the volume associated with the snapshot has been removed from storage

==== Negative flow (VM crashes during live merge) ====
* Start in webadmin with a running VM that has one or more snapshots
* Remove a snapshot as in the positive flow but immediately terminate the VM
* A live merge failure event should appear in the audit log and the snapshot should remain in the list
