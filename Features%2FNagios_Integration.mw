Monitoring the system/Gluster resources and services includes:
*Monitoring of critical entities such as servers, networking, volumes, clusters and services
*Alerting when critical infrastructure components fail and recover, providing administrators with notice of important events. Alerts can be delivered via email, SMS or SNMP.
*Reports providing a historical record of outages, events, notifications, and alert response for later review. 
*Trending and capacity planning graphs and reports that allow for infrastructure upgrades before failures occur.

*Nagios Core
*Nagios Addons - NRPE , NSCA, MK Livestatus, PNP4Nagios etc
*Nagios pluggins
*Ovirt UI Monitoring Plugin

==Productization and Packaging==

*UI Monitoring plugin will be packaged and installed along with Ovirt.
*Nagios core will not be packaged and installed along with Ovirt
*Nagios addons and plugins will not be packaged and installed. This needs to taken done separately on the the monitoring nodes and the server
