== Networking Filtering ==

=== Summary ===
Network filtering provides to the host the capability to control the network traffic.<br>
The initial implementation is focused on preventing from a VM running on the host to impersonate other VMs by spoofing their MAC addresses.<br>

=== Current status ===
* Status: Finalizing requirements.

=== Detailed Description ===
In order to prevent mac spoofing, the Engine will enhance the OOB rules provided by libvirt and specifically:<br>
* no-mac-spoofing 
* no-arp-mac-spoofing.
Once the system is configured for network filtering, those rules will be sent to VDSM upon running VMs, reported for each VM network interface.<br>
VDSM will extent the DOM network interface element sent to libvirt:

   <interface type="bridge">
       <mac address="aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa"/>
       <model type="virtio"/>
       <source bridge="bridge_name"/>
       ...
       <filterref filter='no-arp-mac-spoofing'/>
       <filterref filter='no-mac-spoofing'/>
    </interface>

libvirt will use rules to configure the ebtables to prevent mac spoofing.

==== Installation/Upgrade ====
A new configuration value will be added: 
* '''EnableMACAntiSpoofingFilterRules''' - a system level config to enable/disable this feature. It will be exposed via the engine-config tool.
** Its default value will be set to 'true'.

==== User work-flows ====
The feature will be enabled for '''3.2 cluster level''' and above, as required VDSM API change.

==== Engine ====
'Run VM' process will be changed as follow:
   For each VM network interface being sent to VDSM
     If ''EnableMACAntiSpoofingFilterRules'' is enabled  and cluster level equals/greater than 3.2:
       Add no-mac-spoofing, no-arp-mac-spoofing filter names for the VM interface

Changes will be made in ''VmInfoBuilder.addNetworkInterfaceProperties()''

==== VDSM ====
The VM creation API will be extended to support network filtering for VM nics.
   nicModel
   device
   network
   type
   macAddr
   ....
   filters

Where ''filters'' is a List of filters.

=== Open Issues ===
libvirt version to depend on.
Do the rules being cleared by libvirt from ebtables once the VM is destroyed?
