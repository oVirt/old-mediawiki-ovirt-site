=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
At first stage the ISO will include a collection of tools usable for Windows VMs that run under KVM (oVirt).
The second stage will be to package these within the installers, to make the tools installation as easy as possible.

:*IMPORTANT! First alpha release of oVirt 3.5 WGT is available:
http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-master-snapshot-static/iso/ovirt-guest-tools/ovirt-guest-tools-3.5-1.iso
It currently includes the installer for most VirtIO-Win drivers (Serial, Balloon, Net and Block), Spice QXL and Agent as well as oVirt Guest Agent, as well as the binaries that went into the installer.
VirtIO-SCSI currently needs to be installed manually (from the drivers directory) - hope to fix that in the next release.

The installer itself maybe downloaded from: http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-master-snapshot-static/exe/ovirt-guest-tools/ovirt-guest-tools-3.5-1.exe

The installer is based on the Spice installer's source code, and was slightly modifed for this project's needs.


The current (proposed) list of the software to be included in the ISO:

:*VirtIO-Win drivers:
::* VirtIO-Serial
::* VirtIO-Balloon
::* VirtIO-Net
::* VirtIO-Block
::* VirtIO-SCSI
From: http://secondary.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/virtio-win/latest/


:* Spice drivers and agent
From: http://www.spice-space.org/download/binaries/spice-guest-tools/

Important Note:  It seems that Spice installer (current is spice-guest-tools-0.74.exe [http://www.spice-space.org/download/binaries/spice-guest-tools/spice-guest-tools-0.74.exe]) installs not just Spice related components (QXL and Agent), but all VirtIO-Win drivers as well.

Spice Agents for 32 and 64 bit Windows:
http://www.spice-space.org/download/windows/vdagent/vdagent-win-0.7.2/

Spice QXL for 32 and 64 bit Windows:
http://www.spice-space.org/download/windows/qxl/qxl-0.1-21/

:* Qemu Guest Agent

Need to check if this can be taken from Fedora or we'll need to compile it ourselves.

:* oVirt Guest Agent
Current plan is to cross-compile it using Wine.
Sources are available from the Git repo at: http://gerrit.ovirt.org/ovirt-guest-agent
Initial cross-compilation seems to be successful, but requires further testing on various versions of Windows.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
The ISO image will become a central repository for all the software that Windows based VMs require in order to function in most optimal way under oVirt / KVM.
