=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
The upgrade tool is used to update a running node to a newer version by using the supplied iso image's codebase. This works around multiple upgrade situations where you would need to use installation media for bug fixes applied to the upgrade and installation areas.


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
This allows upgrades directly from the Engine that apply the same as a media based upgrade. This also fixes chicken/egg scenarios that need patches to upgrade correctly.(examples: EFI/grub)
