==Backend Coding Standards==

This page is a collection of coding standards in the ovirt engine backend. Not all of these standards are properly maintained, they are more like 'guidelines'

===Infra Bash Script coding guidelines===

===Java code conventions===

Java code style conventions and best practices should be applied in the project.

Pay particular attention to standard  [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconventions-135099.html#367 Java naming convention]

===oVirt Engine/IDE===

===RowMapper singletons===

RowMappers should have a single instance e.g.

 private final static class FooRowMapper implements ParameterizedRowMapper<Foo> {
   public final static FooRowMapper instance = new FooRowMapper();
   public Foo mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) {
     //and so on...
   }
 }

So you do not have to instantiate the rowmapper all the time.

==To be cleared==

=== Logger ===

Seems like there is no clear agreement on how the loggers should be declared. What is known is that it should be the 'compat' logger.
