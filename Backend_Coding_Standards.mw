=Backend Coding Standards=

This page is a collection of coding standards in the ovirt engine backend. Not all of these standards are properly maintained, they are more like 'guidelines'

== private members should be at the bottom of the class ==

If you have private methods or embedded classes in your class (e.g. a rowmapper class in a DAO), then it should be at the bottom of the class. The idea here is that they are implementation details and viewers should read the public API first.

== RowMapper singletons ==

RowMappers should have a single instance e.g.

 private final static class FooRowMapper implements ParameterizedRowMapper<Foo> {
   public final static FooRowMapper instance = new FooRowMapper();
   public Foo mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) {
     //and so on...
   }
 }

So you do not have to instantiate the rowmapper all the time.
