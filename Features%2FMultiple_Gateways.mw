== Multiple Gateways ==


=== Summary ===
Currently it is assumed that the host-wide default gateway is the gateway defined on the ovirtmgmt logical network.
This feature will enable the user to define the gateway on a logical network basis. Additionally, the ability to select the 
host's default gateway.

=== Why do we need multiple gateways? ===
Now, oVirt assumes that the host's default gateway is the gateway defined on the ovirtmgmt network. With that in mind:
Multiple oVirt users use this network topology:

[[File:Multiple_Gateways_Topology.png]]

The administrator created a new network and set it as the display network. The oVirt host is connected to two networks:
ovirtmgmt (10.0.0.0) via eth0, and the display network (20.0.0.0) via eth1. A user then connected to the engine, selected a VM
on the host and then opened a new Spice console. Network data can reach the host, but all return traffic will route to the 
host's default gateway, which is the gateway defined on ovirtmgmt, reached via eth0. The return traffic will reach R1, but
R1 doesn't have a route to the user's laptop and thus the packets will be dropped at R1. In other words, Spice won't work.

More simply put, pings won't work from the user's laptop to the oVirt host. The traffic will reach the host successfully,
but all return traffic will be routed through the host's default gateway via eth0. The packets will reach R1 and will then
be dropped as R1 cannot route to the user's laptop.

Currently, clients manually edit the host's init scripts and set a different gateway for the display network. This can become
problematic to maintain with a large amount of hosts. The multiple gateways feature will automate this process.

=== User Experience ===
