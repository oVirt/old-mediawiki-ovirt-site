=== oVirt Appliance ===

{{Feature|name=oVirt Appliance |modules=node|version=3.5|status=In Progress}}

=== Summary ===

oVirt appliance will be a raw disk or an ova file that you can import to your existing virtual machine manager and boot it with a complete pre installed oVirt setup.

The first step will be to create an image with the correct functionality, in a second step the correct delivery format will be choosen.
The latter might be currently blocked by the missing functionality in the build tools.
