{{Feature|name=oVirt Appliance |modules=node|version=3.5|status=In Progress}}

=== Summary ===

oVirt appliance will be a raw disk or an ova file that you can import to your existing virtual machine manager and boot it with a complete pre installed oVirt setup.

The first step will be to create an image with the correct functionality, in a second step the correct delivery format will be choosen.
The latter might be currently blocked by the missing functionality in the build tools.

* Builds: http://jenkins.ovirt.org/job/ovirt-appliance_master_merged/lastStableBuild/

=== Current status ===

Builds are stable, build daily and based on latest oVirt 3.5 packages.

Availability: http://jenkins.ovirt.org/view/All/job/ovirt-appliance_master_merged/

=== Details ===

* The appliance will be created using the [https://fedorahosted.org/lorax/ livemedia-creator] - later probably using [http://imgfac.org/ image-factory].
** Reasoning behind this is, that these tools are maintained and support different platforms.
* The platform will be either Fedora or CentOS.
** Fedora for now.
* Configuration
** Engine installed and partially preconfigured

Current limitations:
* It's not built using livemedia-creator, sysprep'ed and sparsify'ed because libvirt is not working nicely on jenkins

=== Use / Test ===

Prerequisites:

* FQDN which can be resolved on your local network

To use the appliance proceed as follows:

# Download the ova image
# Either use the ova in combination with hosted-engine or extract the ova image
# When the image is booted
## When the assistant comes up, set a root password
## Login as root
## Start the Engine configuration using: <code>engine-setup --offline --config-append=ovirt-engine-answers</code>
## Answer the remaining questions, '''take care to use a FQDN which is resolvable on your network'''
