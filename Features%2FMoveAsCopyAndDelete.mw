== Move operation as copy and delete ==

=== Summary ===
A move operation is basically a copy to the destination domain, followed by a deletion from the source domain.
Currently when moving a disk in ovirt, the called vdsm verb is moveImage - which performs the entire operation (copy + delete)
The fact that one verb is called for executing both of the operations causes to few issues that would be resolved by this change - 
1. Increase availabillity - When moving an image and attempting to delete with wipe - the
operation won't wait for the deletion to complete, as it might take a long time although the image in the target domain
is already "ready" for use (as the copy operation has been completed).
2. In case of an error, the engine will be able to tell on which part of the "move" operation
an error has occured  and react accordingly.
3. Moving towards lowering the SPM involvement in the copy/move process.
4. Move operation on vdsm should be deprecated.

=== Current status ===
* Implemented and pushed at http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/13042/ , pending merge.

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
1. Add MoveImageGroupCommand - used for moving images, the execution part (aka - execute() method) contains a call to vdsm to copy the image to the target master domain, while the end method executes a vdsm call for deletion of the unneeded image (in case of succesfull copy - the source image, in case of failure during the copy - the target image).
2. MoveOrCopyImageGroupCommand has been renamed to CopyImageGroupCommand and is being used now for copy only.
3. moveImage verb in vdsm is being executed from the engine with Copy as it's operation only (used for copy without collapsing snapshots).
4. RemoveImageCommand has been changed to allow removal of image without performing DB modification (in case of performing move, the called delete on the end method is for storage "cleanup" and shouldn't affect the db.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Abillity to determine the state of the move operation, have faster operation when performing move with wipe (post zero).

=== Known issues ===
* The whole operation *might* be  slower for moving image groups without wipe
as the delete part is quick (and now we will have two vdsm calls rather
then one) - this issue is known and accepted.
