== Current status ==
* PRD stage
* Last updated date: Tue Dec 20 2011:


== Description ==
The SPM selection process happens when a command needs SPM authorization to run, for example DestroyImageVDSCommand and AttachStorageDomainVDSCommand. Currently, the SPM selection process is random, meaning a host is chosen randomly out of the hosts that are currently UP.


== PRD ==
The requirements are the following:

# Enable setting a priority between -1 and 100 for a host (100 is the highest, -1 means never to chose this host).
# When SPM selection process takes place, use the SPM priority to select an SPM.
# Default for upgrading ovirt will be 50.


== Design ==
Current flow:

# All hosts except in the Data Center are fetched.
# One is chosen randomly, and SPMStatusVDSCommand is called with it.
# If it returns with status free and (spmStatus.getSpmId() != -1) --> this host is chosen as the new SPM.

New Design:

# Adding a vds_spm_priority field to vds_static.
## This field is configurable upon host creation and host editing by the admin.
