How to run vdsm Nose Tests:

# First you must have a vdsm git repository: <pre>git clone ssh://username@gerrit.ovirt.org:29418/vdsm</pre>
# Install python-nose
# To perform static tests (pyflakes and pep8) use: 'make check-local'
# To run all of the tests use: <pre>make check</pre>
#* Please notice that 'make rpm' also runs all of the tests automatically.
# To run a specific test use: '<tt>../tests/run_tests.sh _____Tests.py</tt>' in the directory <tt>vdsm/vdsm</tt>
# We strongly prefer you don't use the following option, but if you must it is possible to exclude some of the tests using: 'NOSE_EXCLUDE='(here you create your rule)'
