How to run vdsm Nose Tests:
1. First you must have a vdsm git repository: git clone ssh://username@gerrit.ovirt.org:29418/vdsm

2. Install python-nose

3. To perform static tests (pyflakes and pep8) use: 'make check-local'

4. To run all of the tests use: make check

5. Please notice that 'make rpm' also runs all of the tests automatically.

6. To run a specific test use: '../tests/run_tests.sh _____Tests.py' in the directory vdsm/vdsm

7. We strongly prefer you don't use the following option, but if you must it is possible to exclude some of the tests using: 'NOSE_EXCLUDE='(here you create your rule)'
