= Install / Upgrade from previous versions=

== BETA RELEASE ==
oVirt 3.3.3 is still in beta. In order to install it you've to enable oVirt beta repository '''please wait for official announcement before trying to install it'''.

If you're going to test  oVirt 3.3.3 beta, please add yourself to [[Testing/Ovirt 3.3.3 testing]].

== Fedora / CentOS / RHEL ==
If you're installing oVirt 3.3.3 on a clean host you should read our [[Quick Start Guide]]

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.3 you should just execute:
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
 # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.2 you should read [[oVirt 3.2 to 3.3 upgrade]]

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.1 you should upgrade to 3.2 before upgrading to 3.3.3.
Please read [[oVirt 3.1 to 3.2 upgrade]] before starting the upgrade.<br>
On CentOS and RHEL:
For upgrading to 3.2 you'll need 3.2 stable repository.<br>
So, first step is disable 3.3 / stable repository and enable 3.2 in /etc/yum.repos.d/ovirt.repo:

 [ovirt-32]
 name=Stable builds of the oVirt 3.2 project
 baseurl=http://ovirt.org/releases/3.2/rpm/EL/$releasever/
 enabled=1
 skip_if_unavailable=1
 gpgcheck=0

Then
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
should install  ovirt-engine-setup-3.2.3-1.el6.noarch.rpm<br>
if you have already updated to 3.3.x please use distro-sync or downgrade instead of update.<br>
Then:
 # engine-upgrade
this will upgrade your system to latest 3.2.<br>
Once you've all working on 3.2, enable 3.3/stable repository, then just
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
 # engine-setup
will upgrade to latest 3.3.
