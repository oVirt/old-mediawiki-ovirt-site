* Last updated date: Wed Nov 9 2011


== Detailed Description ==
Today, oVirt doesn't have a mechanism for limiting user resource usage.
Such a mechanism is important, especially in multi-tenant environments.<BR>
Thus, the Quota feature will add a mechanism to manage and monitor the resource usage in such environments.<BR>
This mechanism should provide the administrator a management configuration page, to set rules for each aspect, crucial enough, to be management consumable.

== Benefit to oVirt ==
The Quota feature enables limiting resources, which is highly relevant in multi-tenant environments (such as public and private cloud providers).
This can help oVirt get better exposure in such environments.


== Dependencies / Related Features ==
<!-- What other packages (RPMs) depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->
Quota is relevant in every feature that either explicitly or implicitly manage resources in the oVirt engine.

Affected oVirt projects:
* API
* CLI
* Engine-core
* Webadmin
* User Portal

Quota has to be taken in consideration, for every new feature that will involve consumption of resources managed by it.
