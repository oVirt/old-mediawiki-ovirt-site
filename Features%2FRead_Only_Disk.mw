=== Current status ===
* Target Release: 3.2
* Status: work in progress
* Last updated date: 12/17/2012

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
When adding/attaching a disk to a vm,  add a property of RO.  The RO property is not a disk property. It's a property of the VM-Disk relationship, and therefore is persisted through VMDevice (vm_device in the DB). A shareable disk could be attached to one VM as RO, and to another as RW. This is the case as long as the disk is not qCow. qCow disks currently cannot be shared. When that'll change, it shouldn't be allowed to attach a RW qCow disk to one VM while attaching it as RO to another. 

====DB====
vm_device table already has a read_only column. No update to the DB is needed.

====Backend====
AddDiskCommand,  AttachDiskToVmCommand - Add the RO property and propagate until VMDevice creation.
All relating Parameters classes should now contain this info. Therefore,  VmDiskOperatinParameterBase will be added a new readOnly data member.
ImagesHandler.addDiskToVm() -  will get the RO data and propagate it.

No changes need in:
HotPlugDiskToVmCommand
UpdateVmDiskCommand
DetachDiskFromVmCommand
CreateCloneOfTemplateCommand
AddVmTemplateDevice
AddVmFromTemplateCommand
CreateSnapshotFromTemplate
AddVmFromSnapshotCommand
AddVmAndCloneImageCommand
OvfReader.readVmDevice() (already reads the readOnly property).
OvfWriter.writeVmDeviceInfo() (already writes the readOnly property).

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
This features allows the usage of read only disks. This is useful where we'd like to expose the data but don't want it to be altered.  This is a new feature in the engine, allowing the attachment of a disk to a VM to be done with read only rights.  A shareable disk could be attached to one VM as RO, and to another as RW.
