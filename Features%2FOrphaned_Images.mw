=== Detailed Description ===
During normal disk operations, for various reasons, a disk might be removed from the Engine database, but will nonetheless linger on the actual storage, taking up space and causing confusion when the storage domains' stats are reviewed. 
This can happen due to a disk remove task failing at some point, snapshot images not removed after having been collapsed etc.
Such images, that are no longer known to the oVirt engine because they are not in the database, but are still physically present on the storage are defined as "Orphaned" and should be specifically treated to free up space and maintain order.


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Stabilize the system functionality addressing the corner cases where disk removal failed to complete successfully.

=== User Experience ===
The user will issue a command specifying the Storage Domain or Data Centre to search for orphaned images on. 
Then the user will be presented with the list of images detected on the SD, that do not appear in the database, and the image details
The user will have the option to clean the specified SD of orphaned images.

The command will be present as a utility in the Engine - engine-clean-orhaned-images

Example usage:
 engine-clean-orhaned-images --storage-domain=MySD
