== Summary ==
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
The Backup Awareness UI will include a backup status screen, which will be automatically displayed in the web-admin upon login in case there are missing and/or outdated files/db backups (see [[Ovirt-engine-backup]]). 
This screen will contain the overall backup status of the system, individual statuses per backup type and a link leading to information about the engine backup options.

== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->

[^^^ Figure 1]

A "Backup Status" side tab will be added to the "Configure" dialog [0]. 

The "Backup Status" section will include information about the files and db backup status of the engine (and no other backup type at this point). 

It will include:

* '''The overall status of the engine backup [1]''': can be:
** Green (OK) - "Backup is up to date" - in case both db and files backups exist and are up to date (see Figure 2). 
** Orange (Warning) - "Backup is missing and/or outdated" - otherwise (i.e. db backup is missing or outdated or files backup is missing or outdated) (see Figure 3). 
* '''The specific status of the files backup [2]''': can be:
** Green (OK) - the last successful backup date/time will be displayed (see Figure 2). 
** Orange (Warning) - "Files backup is outdated" - the last successful backup date/time will be displayed (see Figure 3). 
** Red (Error) - "Files backup is missing" (see the "Data-base backup is missing" [3] in Figure 3 for reference - should be very similar). 
* '''The specific status of the db backup [3]''': can be:
** Green (OK) - the last successful backup date/time will be displayed (see Figure 2). 
** Orange (Warning) - "Data-base backup is outdated" - the last successful backup date/time will be displayed (see the "Files backup is outdated" [2] in Figure 3 for reference - should be very similar).  
** Red (Error) - "Files backup is missing" (see Figure 3). 
* '''Information regarding whether the system is checking for and notifying about missing/outdated backups and if so - at what frequency [4]''': can be:
** Green (OK) - in case the system is configured to check for and notify about missing/outdated backup; the check+notification frequency will be mentioned, as well as explanations on this piece of information and how to change the frequency setting / disable the feature (see Figure 2). 
** Orange (Warning) - in case the system has backup awareness disabled (i.e. the system is configured to not check nor notify about missing/outdated backup); explanations on how to enable the feature will be mentioned (see Figure 3). 
* '''Information regarding the configured definition of an up-to-date backup''', as well as information on how to change this configuration setting [5]. 
* '''Reference to extra information on the engine backup options [6]'''. The link will lead to the [[Ovirt-engine-backup]] page. 

The "Configure" dialog will automatically be displayed upon successful login to the admin portal if:
* The overall backup status is not green, and:
* The engine is configured to check and notify about the backup status at some frequency (i.e. the "BackupCheckPeriodInHours" configuration value is not "-1" - see [[Features/BackupAwareness#Detailed_Description]]).

== Benefit to oVirt ==
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
The idea is to make sure that the user is aware of the backup options for oVirt in general, as well as notified about the current status of the backup of his engine setup in particular, so he will be able to act accordingly on time, make sure that his backup is always up to date, and consequently minimize downtime in case data recovery is needed. 

== Dependencies / Related Features ==
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->
Obviously, this feature depends on [[Ovirt-engine-backup]] and [[Features/BackupAwareness]]. 

This feature requires that we will have the following data retrievable from the engine (via a backend query/queries): 
* The BackupAlertPeriodInDays configuration value. 
* The BackupCheckPeriodInHours configuration value. 
* An indication whether any successful files-backup exist, the date of the latest successful files-backup and whether this backup is considered up-to-date or not (based on the BackupAlertPeriodInDays configuration value)'''(**)'''. 
* Same as ^^^, for db-backup. 

'''(**) Note''': The client should not determine whether a backup is up-to-date or not, since the client machine time-setting may be different from the engine's time-setting. So the indication whether a backup is up-to-date or not should arrive from the backend. Another option is for the engine to provide a query that will return its current date/time, so that the client will be able to perform a correct time-delta calculation.

== Testing ==

# Install oVirt 
# Do not perform any backups 
# Log into web-admin 
# '''Expected Results 1''': The "Configure" dialog should be automatically displayed with information about the missing backups.  
# Click on the link for the extra information on backup options. 
# '''Expected Results 2''': The extra-information page is opened in a new browser tab/window. 
# Close web-admin 
# Change BackupCheckPeriodInHours to "-1", restart engine / reload configuration (if this configuration value is re-loadable - see [[Features/ReloadableConfiguration]])
# Log into web-admin 
# '''Expected Results 3''': The "Configure" dialog should not be displayed.  
# Go to the "Configure" dialog -> "Backup Status" section.  
# '''Expected Results 4''': Dialog should display same information as in "Expected Results 1". 
# Close web-admin 
# Change BackupCheckPeriodInHours to a value other than "-1", restart engine / reload configuration (if this configuration value is re-loadable)
# Perform a files backup using the 'engine-backup' tool
# Log into web-admin 
# '''Expected Results 5''': The "Configure" dialog should be automatically displayed with information about the recent files backup as well as the missing db backup.  
# Perform a db backup using the 'engine-backup' tool
# Close/re-open the "Configure" dialog -> "Backup Status" section
# '''Expected Results 6''': Dialog should display information about the recent files backup as well as the recent db backup. 
# Close web-admin 
# Ensure that the existing backups are not up-to-date (by waiting for BackupAlertPeriodInDays days or manipulating the backup dates somehow in the db, etc. )
# Log into web-admin 
# '''Expected Results 7''': The "Configure" dialog should be automatically displayed with information about the outdated backup. 
# Close web-admin 
# Change the BackupAlertPeriodInDays configuration value to a large number (e.g. 100). 
# Open web-admin
# '''Expected Results 8''': The "Configure" dialog should not be displayed.  
# Open the "Configure" dialog -> "Backup Status" section
# '''Expected Results 9''': Dialog should display an OK backup status with information about the latest files backup as well as the latest db backup.

== Your feature heading ==

A backup status screen will be automatically displayed in the web-admin upon login in case there are missing and/or outdated files/db backups. 
This screen will contain the overall backup status of the system, individual status per backup type and a link leading to extra information about the engine backup options.
