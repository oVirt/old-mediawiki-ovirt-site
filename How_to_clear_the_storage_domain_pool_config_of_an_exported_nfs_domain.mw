On some occassions, e.g. after backing up your export domain(s) and wiping the HV, when the original host / domain is no longer available, you're unable to attach it to your new HV/Data Center as it is already attached to the previous one. Here are some steps that will help you import VMs from a "abandoned" export domain. 

== Assumptions and Pre-Requisites ==

* You know how to export a folder/directory via NFS
* You have setup ovirt manager and HV (ovirt-node) at least once successfully before
* You know what an Export Domain is

== A few quick steps ==

So let's say you backed up your export domain as a .tgz - you need to unpack its content and make it available via the newly created NFS export. Unpack that .tgz into the same path

<pre>
tar -zxf /path/to/yourfile.tgz -C /path/to/nfsexport/
</pre>

Once extracted, you need to edit one of the files to clear the storage domain its already allocated : 

Edit the file 

<pre>
/path/to/nfsexport/storagedomain/dom_md/metadata
</pre> 

Ensure that the value for "pool uuid" is empty

<pre>
POOL_UUID=
</pre>

And ensure that the sha checksum is completely removed - the line must not exist in that file

<pre>
_SHA_CKSUM
</pre>

Finally, add a new NFS Export Domain to your new HV / Data Center as you did to your previous host, oVirt Manager should detect that a storage domain exists, once activated you'll be able to re-import the VMs into your new HV / Data Center.
