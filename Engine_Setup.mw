= Engine Setup =

Some information about engine-setup and related tools - this currently includes engine-setup, engine-cleanup and [[Changing_Engine_Hostname|ovirt-engine-rename]].

These tools are based on [[Otopi]].

== Configuration ==

These tools share the following:

=== /etc/ovirt-engine-setup.conf.d/*.conf ===

All of these tools read all of the configuration files /etc/ovirt-engine-setup.conf.d/*.conf .

Generally speaking, users should not touch these files. Some of them are shipped inside the rpm packages, and some are maintained by the tools themselves - keeping state needed between runs of these tools.

=== Answer files ===

All of these tools generate upon completion an answer file, named '/var/lib/ovirt-engine/setup/answers/*.conf', and mention that in their output.

The expected way to use these answer files is:

# Have a system A in some state S0
# Run one of the tools interactively, answer its questions as needed,
 let it create an answer file Ans1.
# System A is now in state S1.
# Have some other system B in state S0, that you want to bring to state S1.
# Run there the same tool with --config-append=Ans1

Manually editing such an answer file is generally not supported/expected. You might do that to achieve special non-standard goals. If you do that, you should thoroughly verify that it works for you, and use in a controller environment - same known initial state, same versions of relevant stuff, etc.

Just as an example for a simple and useful violation, if during testing
you often run engine-setup on systems with little RAM, and want to get
rid of the question if you want to continue with not enough RAM, you
can create a file e.g. /etc/ovirt-engine-setup.conf.d/99-my-stuff.conf
with content:
 [environment:default]
 OVESETUP_SYSTEM/memCheckEnabled=bool:False
