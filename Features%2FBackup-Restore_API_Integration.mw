== Backup and Restore API for Independent Software Vendors ==  
=== Summary === 
This feature provides the ability for ISVs to backup and restore VMs.<BR>
New set of APIs will be introduced in oVirt to facilitate taking full VM backup, as well as full or file level restore of VMs.<BR>
Backup and Restore will be REST API driven (and not GUI/User driven).

* VDSM Component owner: Federico Simoncelli <fsimonce@redhat.com>

=== Detailed Description === 
The Backup API provides set of operations that can be used for implemenating backup solution for VMs/Data using oVirt.

=== High Level Architecture === 

The Backup Appliance can be in the form of a Virtual Appliance (VirtApp) or Host Appliance (HostApp). 
'''Currently we are targetting VirtApp usecase, HostApp usecase will be targetted later.'''
Backup & Restore API will can be driven by API while some functionallities would be available by GUI as well.
Backup/Restore software from ISV will drive these APIs.
 
== VM Backup/Restore possible flows ==
=== General background === 
The Ovirt snapshot feature provides the user the ability to seize the VM in a specific point in time.<BR>
The snapshot will contain the VM configuration and its disks data in a static way<BR>
The underline operation, is to create for each disk in the VM a new volume which will be based on the previous volume using qcow2 format, the original volume will becomes R/O and the new volume will only indicate the differences from the original volume.

The Backup API use the snapshot feature to provide a temporary volume on the backup appliance.<BR>
The temporary volume will act as an active volume based on the destination snapshot of the VM about to be backed up.<BR>
The new temporary volume will provide the backup appliance access to the VM data.<BR>
This snapshot which is created as part of the backup API will not be exposed to the user, but will only be exposed at the system level and by the API to the backup appliance.

=== Full VM backups === 
Full VM backup can be implemented for example by using the following oVirt capabillities:
#  Take a vm snapshot for the vm targeted for backup  - (existing oVirt REST API operation)
#  Backup the vm configuration at the time of the snapshot (Disks configuration can be backed up as well if needed)  -  (added capabillity to oVirt as part of the Backup API)
#  Attach the disk snapshots that were created in (1) to the virtual appliance for data backup -  (added capabillity to oVirt as part of the Backup API)
#  <data can be backed up>
#  Detach the disk snapshots that were attached in (4) from the virtual appliance  -  (added capabillity to oVirt as part of the Backup API)

==== Example for VM backup ====
* Use existing VM Snapshot/Create a vm snapshot  (example):
  SERVER:PORT/api/vms/VM_ID/snapshots
  Method = POST
  (with Content-Type:application/xml header)
 
  <snapshot>
  <description>Virtual Machine 1 - Snapshot For Backup</description>
  </snapshot>

*Grab the wanted vm configuration from the needed snapshot - it'll be under initialization/configuration/data
   SERVER:PORT/api/vms/VM_ID/snapshots/ID
   Method = GET

* Navigate to the wanted disk snapshot by accessing: ([[Features/Backup-Restore_API_Integration#Get_disk_snapshot_data|Example]])<BR>
  SERVER:PORT/api/vms/GUID/snapshots/GUID/disks

* Attach the disk snapshot to the vm using the disk id and the snapshot id:  ([[Features/Backup-Restore_API_Integration#Attach_disk_to_backup_VM|Example]])<BR>
   http://SERVER:PORT/api/vms/GUID/disks/
   Method = POST
   (with Content-Type:application/xml header)

   <disk id="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx">
    <snapshot id="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"/>
   </disk>

* After copying the data from the disk detach the disk snapshot from the VM using the REST with the following parameters  ([[Features/Backup-Restore_API_Integration#Detach_disk_from_backup_VM|Example]]):
  Method = DELETE
  URL indicates to the specific disk in the VM: 
       http://SERVER:PORT/api/vms/GUID/disks/GUID
  Body=<action><detach>true</detach></action>

=== Full VM restore === 
#  Create disks for restore
#   Attach the disks for restore to the virtual appliance (Restore the data to it)
#  Detach the disks from the virtual appliance.
#  Create a vm using the configuration that was saved as part of the backup flow  - (added capabillity to oVirt as part of the Backup API)
#  Attach the restored disks to the created vm.

==== Example for VM restore ====
1. Create a disk to restore:
POST the new disk :  ([[Features/Backup-Restore_API_Integration#Backup-Restore_API_Integration|Example]])<BR>
   http://SERVER:PORT/api/disks/

2. Attach the disk to the  virtual appliance: 
POST the copied disk with the disk id : <BR>
   http://SERVER:PORT/api/vms/GUID/disks/
  <disk id="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx">
  </disk>

3. After copying the data from the disk detach the disk snapshot from the VM using the REST with the following parameters  ([[Features/Backup-Restore_API_Integration#Detach_disk_from_backup_VM|Example]]):
 Method = DELETE
 URL indicates to the specific disk in the VM: 
      http://SERVER:PORT/api/vms/GUID/disks/GUID
 Body=<action><detach>true</detach></action>

==== DIfference between Virtual appliance and Host appliance ====
Currently per the design, the difference is in the way that the data is would be exposed/restored.
Backup - the disks snapshot for backup should be exposed on some host so it could be mounted and backed up through the needed HostApp with the backup software.
Restore - an abillity to restore the data to an ovirt disk should be introduced.

=== File level backup/restore === 
File level restore/backed is essentially the same as the described VM backup/restore flows -  as soon as the data is accessible by the backup provider the needed files can be backed up/restored.

=== LAN Free backup ===
Support for LAN-Free backup: oVirt provides SAN access to the disk devices out of the box.

=== User interface === 
N/A

=== Current Status === 
* Live snapshot : Done. Available in oVirt. 
* Live Merge: To be integrated in oVirt
* Qemu-ga: To be integrated.
* VDSM support : http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/q/status:open+project:vdsm+branch:master+topic:backup-restore,n,z
* oVirt Engine / API support :
** Attach/Detach/Hotplug/Hotunplug Disk snapshot to a vm:  http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/17679/
** Add VM from configuration : http://gerrit.ovirt.org/15894
** Get snapshot vm ovf configuration:  http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/16176/
* UI support :  N/A

=== This feature will be implemented in phases: ===
# Phase1 will cover Full backup/restore for VirtApp usecase as well as single file level restore, as well  will cover HostApp usecase and guest quiesce for application-level consistency.  The oVirt Backup and Restore API will provide integration with Microsoft Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) using QEMU-GA.   QEMU-GA provides VSS support and live snapshot automatically tries to quiesce whenever possible. (The VSS provider registration will be made in the guest level as part of the Guest Tools deployment.)
# Phase 2  will cover Change Block Tracking (CBT) to cover incremental backups. This also depends on the ongoing community work in qemu block layer to provide differential info

=== Recommendations: ===
* Block Device ID management considerations: method to track the device ID once attached to the Backup virtual appliance.
* We should just name the snapshot with a proper prefix (e.g. "TSM Backup") to make it clear what it's about.

=== Future Work ===
See phases section above

==== Incremental VM backups ==== 
Back up only the virtual machine data that has changed since the last backup. All data is backed up at the disk block level.

==== Differential VM backups ==== 
Backup all the changes since the last full backup. Differential backup is a cumulative backup of all changes since last full backup. Incremental backup contains only the changes since the last incremental backup whereas differential backup contains all changes since the last FULL backup.

==== Guest Quiesce for application-level consistency ====
===== Windows: ===== 
The Backup and Restore API will provide integration with Microsoft Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) using qeum-ga.  The VSS provider registration will be made in the guest level as part of the Guest Tools deployment. 
===== Linux: ===== 
Qemu-ga provides filesystem-level consistency for Linux, a hook can be executed to allow online disk snapshot for online-backup with application-level consistency of the snapshot image. A hook can  provide the opportunity to quiesce applications before the snapshot is taken on fsfreeze-freeze/thaw.

=== Open Issues ===
=== Benefits to oVirt === 
Complete API providing abillity to do full , file-level & incremental backups/restores of a running VM.
