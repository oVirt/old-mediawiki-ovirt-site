= Overview =
A network provider is an external provider that can provide networking capabilities for consumption by oVirt hosts and/or virtual machines.
The network provider has the knowledge about the networks that it manages, and works autonomously from oVirt.
The provider should enable integration on 3 points:
* Discovery of networks
* Provisioning of networks
* Provisioning of virtual NICs on the network

= Required capabilities =
== Network discovery ==
There should be a way for oVirt to discover what networks are available on the provider.
An oVirt user could then decide to import a network, that is provided by the provider, as a new one into a data center, or attach it to an existing data center network, marking that the network is also provided by this provider (in addition to any other provider that provides it).

Question: Can an imported network be implemented internally, or if it's external network then we don't control it?

Currently, we assume that the networks provided by the provider are available on all hosts in the data center, but it is possible to have this capability added so that we would be able to query the provider if a specific host provides a given network or not.

== Network provisioning ==
The network can be exported from oVirt into the network provider, but from that moment on it will be as if the network was discovered from the provider - i.e. if it goes out of sync, that's OK from oVirt's perspective.

== Virtual NIC provisioning ==
The network provider should be able to provision a virtual NIC's data (name, MAC, etc) on a network that it provides.
oVirt would send the virtual NIC details over to the provider, and it should return the NIC connection details.
These connection details should be used when the VM is  run, or the NIC is plugged.

There should also be an option to "un-provision" a virtual NIC so that is being provisioned by the provider.
