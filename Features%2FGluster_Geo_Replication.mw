==Summary==
This feature allows the administrator to configure, start, stop and monitor geo-replication for Gluster volumes from oVirt engine. With this the administrator can view the status of geo-replication on Gluster volumes and also would be able to start/stop/configure geo-replication for a volume. GlusterFS geo-replication provides a continuous, asynchronous, and incremental replication service from one site to another over Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Network (WANs), and across the Internet.

== Current Status ==

* Status: In Progress
* Last updated date: Thu Jan 17 2013

== Detailed Description ==
GlusterFS Geo-replication uses a master–slave model, whereby replication and mirroring occurs between the following partners:
*Master – A GlusterFS volume
*Slave – A GlusterFS Volume in a remote cluster

With this feature the user will be able to
* View all active/inactive geo-replication sessions in the cluster
* Setup a new ge-replication session
* Start a geo-replication session
* Stop a geo-replication session
* Remove an inactive geo-replication session
* Setup password less SSH between one of the hosts in the cluster and remote host
* View and update the configuration before starting the session or later (ssh command, gsync command)
* Monitor the status of geo-replication sessions in a cluster

== Design ==
Geo-replication feature is designed to enable creation and maintenance of geo-replication sessions across clusters in GlusterFS. A geo-replication session can be setup between a GlusterFS managed master cluster and remote (slave) GlusterFS managed cluster.

=== Entity Description ===
<TBD>

=== User Experience ===
==== Setting up Password less SSH ====
Password less SSH communication should be enabled between one node of the master cluster and one node of remote (slave) cluster before creating a geo-replication session between the identified master and slave clusters.
If the Password less SSH communication failed between the hosts at the time of  starting the geo-replication session, the following dialog will be shown.

[[File:Geo-Replication-Start-SSH-Setup.png]]

The user will be given two choices 
* '''Use a different private key''' by providing the location of the key file. Password less SSH communication will be verified using this private key file.
(or)
* Provide the password of the user in remote host which is entered in the [[:File:Geo-Replication-Start.png|Geo-Replication-Start]] dialog to setup password less SSH.

==== Create a  new Geo-Replication Session ====
<TBD>

==== View All Geo-Replication Sessions ====
A new sub tab will be added to the Volumes main tab in oVirt webadmin UI which will list all the geo-replication sessions for the selected volume.

==== Start a new Geo-Replication Session ====
A new action named '''Start''' will be shown in the '''Geo-Replication''' tab. On clicking of the action will open the following dialog.

[[File:Geo-Replication-Start.png]]

* '''Start Geo-Replication from Host''' field will list all the servers in the cluster which are in '''UP''' state. When the user selects one of the host, SSH Fingerprint of the host will be fetched and shown.
* '''Remote Host''' could be either a standalone machine or part of another cluster. 
* '''Remote Volume/Path''' will accept either name of a volume in a remote cluster or a directory in the remote host. If it doesn't starts with '''/''', it will be considered as a volume in the remote cluster. 
* After providing all the details and when the user clicks '''Ok''',
** Password less SSH communication between the origin host  and '''Remote Host''' will be verified.
** If that succeeded, the geo-replication session for the selected volume started
** Else the [[:File:Geo-Replication-Start-SSH-Setup[.png|Passwordless SSH Setup]] dialog will be shown.
* If the user wants to override the default configuration, he/she can deselect '''Use Default''' checkbox and provide different configuration. In this case no password less SSH verification will be made. 

==== Stop a Geo-Replication Session ====
<TBD>

==== Remove a Geo-Replication Session ====
<TBD>
