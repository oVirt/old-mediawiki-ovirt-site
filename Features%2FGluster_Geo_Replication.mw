== Current Status ==

* Status: In Progress
* Last updated date: Mon Oct 22 2012

== Detailed Description ==
GlusterFS Geo-replication uses a master–slave model, whereby replication and mirroring occurs between the following partners:
*Master – A GlusterFS volume
*Slave – A slave can be of the following types:
**A local directory which can be represented as file URL like file:///path/to/dir. You can use shortened form, for example: /path/to/dir.
**A GlusterFS Volume - Slave Volume can be either a local volume like gluster://localhost:volname (shortened form - :volname) or a volume served by different host like gluster://host:volname (shortened form - host:volname).

Configuring and Monitoring unidirectional Geo Replication (master-slave).

The following features will be supported 
* Setting up passwordless SSH
* Configuring and Starting Geo Replication
* Displaying Geo-replication status information
