==Summary==
This feature allows the user to configure, start, stop and monitor Geo-Replication sessions for Gluster Volumes. GlusterFS Geo-replication provides a continuous, asynchronous, and incremental replication service from one site to another over Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Network (WANs), and across the Internet.

== Current Status ==

* Status: In Progress
* Last updated date: Mon Nov 2 2012

== Detailed Description ==
GlusterFS Geo-replication uses a master–slave model, whereby replication and mirroring occurs between the following partners:
*Master – A GlusterFS volume
*Slave – A slave can be of the following types:
**A directory in a remote host.
**A GlusterFS Volume in a remote host/cluster.

With this feature the user will be able to
* Setup Passwordless SSH between one of the servers in the cluster and remote host
* Start a new Geo-Replication session
* Change the configuration before starting the session or later
* Stop any running Geo-Replication session
* Monitor the statuses of Geo-Replication session in a cluster
* Remove any inactive session
