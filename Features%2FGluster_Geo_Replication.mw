{{Feature|name=Geo replication|modules=engine,gluster|version=3.6|status=In Progress}}
==Summary==
This feature allows the administrator to create, start, stop and monitor geo-replication  for Gluster volumes from oVirt engine. With this the administrator can view the status of geo-replication sessions on Gluster volumes and also would be able to start/stop the geo-replication sessions. GlusterFS geo-replication provides a continuous, asynchronous, distributed and incremental replication service from one site to another over Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Network (WANs), and across the Internet.

== Current Status ==

* Status: In Progress
* Last updated date: {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}<!--This is markup for current date, do not change-->

== Detailed Description ==
GlusterFS Geo-replication uses a Source–Destination model, whereby replication and mirroring occurs between the following partners:
* Source – A GlusterFS volume
* Destination – A GlusterFS Volume in a remote cluster

With this feature the user will be able to
* View all a geo-replication sessions for a volume
* Setup a new ge-replication session
* Start a geo-replication session
* Stop a geo-replication session
* Remove an inactive geo-replication session
* View and update the configuration before starting the session or later (ex: change detector)
* Monitor the status of geo-replication sessions

== Design ==

=== User Experience ===
The following section goes through the user flows associated with the feature.
==== Geo-Replication Sessions ====
A new sub tab '''Geo-Replication''' will be added to the '''Volumes''' main tab in oVirt webadmin UI which will list all the geo-replication sessions for the selected volume.
Geo-Replication Sessions subtab  also provides actions for 
* Creating a new geo-replication session
* Starting a geo-replication session
* Stopping a geo-replication session
* View details of a geo-replication session, this includes the list of individual geo-replication session and their respective status
* Update configurations for a geo-replication session
* Removing an existing geo-replication session

In the Volumes main tab, an icon will be introduced to indicate if geo-replication has been set up for the volume. Clicking on the icon will activate the geo-replication sub-tab.
From this sub tab, the user can view all the remote volumes (destination) where this volume is being replicated to as shown below:

If there are no sessions that are setup, the Geo-replication sub-tab will have only the New button enabled.  (Should the Geo-replication sub tab be shown in this case? How will the user create a new geo-replication session?)

If the volume is a destination for another volume, there will be another icon to indicate this. Clicking on this icon will show a pop-up which will the source volume details.

==== Create a  new Geo-Replication Session ====

To set up geo-replication session, the user will click on New from the Geo-replication sub tab. (User can also click on the Geo-replication --> New from the Volume main tab ?)

The below dialog captures the details and creates the geo-replication session between source and destination gluster volumes.
* To set up geo-replication as non-root user, the user name will be captured in the below dialog. (As there's currently an RFE to support this in gluster, the username root will be non-editable for now)
* The destination volumes will be auto-populated based on criteria - volumes that are online, belong to remote clusters and have capacity greater than the selected volume
** User can choose to provide a volume outside of this list. In this case "force" option will be used while creating the session.

* User has the option to start the session automatically once created. A check box will be provided to do that.

==== Start a new Geo-Replication Session ====
A new action named '''Start''' will be shown in the '''Geo-Replication''' tab, which will  start the selected geo-replication session(s).

==== Stop a Geo-Replication Session ====
A new action named '''Stop''' will be shown in the '''Geo-Replication''' tab, which will  stop the selected geo-replication session(s).

==== Remove a Geo-Replication Session ====
A new action named '''Remove''' will be shown in the '''Geo-Replication''' tab, which will remove the selected geo-replication session(s).

==== Configuration Options for  Geo-Replication Session ====
The below dialog fetches and lists the default values of all the configurations for a geo-replication session. It provides an option to change the values of the configurations. User can change the values of the configuration properties at any point of time after creating the geo-replication session. The geo-replication session will be restarted automatically if the user changes any configuration when the session is already started.

==== Geo-Replication Session Details ====

With the distributed geo-replication, when a geo-replication session is created for a volume, internally geo-rep process will be running on each of the nodes where the bricks are residing. This view will list all the individual nodes, their status and Up time. Additionally this will also contain the detailed status for each node

=== Limitations ===
* Cascaded viewing is not available. (Sometimes a volume can be used as both source as well as destination)

== Open Issues ==
* Currently it is not possible to detect a volume is being used as a destination for a geo-replication session
**  UUID of the source volume can retrieved from the gluster, but its not possible to determine which source cluster it belongs to.
