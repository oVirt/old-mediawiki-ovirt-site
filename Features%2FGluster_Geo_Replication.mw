==Summary==
This feature allows the administrator to configure, start, stop and monitor geo-replication for Gluster volumes from oVirt engine. With this the administrator can view the status of geo-replication on Gluster volumes and also would be able to start/stop/configure geo-replication for a volume. GlusterFS geo-replication provides a continuous, asynchronous, and incremental replication service from one site to another over Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Network (WANs), and across the Internet.

== Current Status ==

* Status: In Progress
* Last updated date: Thu Jul 25 2013

== Detailed Description ==
GlusterFS Geo-replication uses a Source–Destination model, whereby replication and mirroring occurs between the following partners:
* Source – A GlusterFS volume
* Destination – A GlusterFS Volume in a remote cluster

With this feature the user will be able to
* View all the destinations attached to a cluster
* Add a new destination and enable password less communication between a host of source cluster and a host of destination cluster
* Test password less communication to destination cluster/host
*  Remove(Detach) a destination cluster
* View all active/inactive geo-replication sessions for a volume
* Setup a new ge-replication session
* Start a geo-replication session
* Stop a geo-replication session
* Remove an inactive geo-replication session
* View and update the configuration before starting the session or later (ssh command, gsync command)
* Monitor the status of geo-replication sessions in a cluster
