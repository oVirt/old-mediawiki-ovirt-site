== DRBD & Pacemaker for oVirt ==

=== Summary ===
To provide a highly avialable virtualization environment with oVirt we are going to use two physical machines providing a bare KVM (hosting the oVirt Manager) and an iSCSI target as storage for the virtual guests. Furthermore, the two physical nodes will be used as oVirt hypervisors. We will use to use DRBD for data replication of the KVM and the iSCSI-storage between the nodes. Pacemaker
and heartbeat will serve as the cluster management system.
