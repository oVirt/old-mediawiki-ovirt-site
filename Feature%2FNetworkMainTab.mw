=== Detailed Description ===

==== User Experience ====
==== Tree ====

===== New items: =====
#'''Networks''' (a tree item under dc)
#* Displayed Tabs (the tabs that are displayed when the item is selected in the tree)- 
#** Networks (search criteria- "Network: datacenter.name = 'dcName'")
#* Children- all dc networks
# '''Network''' (a tree item under Networks, specific network name)
#* Displayed Tabs-
#** Networks (search criteria- "Network: name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'")
#** Clusters (search criteria- "Cluster: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'")
#** Hosts (search criteria- "Host: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'")
#** Virtual Machines (search criteria- "Vms: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'")
#** Templates (search criteria- "Template: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'")
#* Children - none

===== Selected items in the tree that show Networks tab: =====
* Networks
* Network
* Dc
* Cluster
* Host

==== Main-Tab ====
* '''Columns'''- Name, Data Center, VM Network, VLAN tagging, Mtu, Description
* '''Actions'''
:* Add - Same as Add network from Data Centers->Logical Networks sub tab. Only change- first field will be "Data Center" combo box. All the dialog under the "Data Center" combo will be refreshed according to the dc change.
:* Edit- Same as Edit network from Data Centers->Logical Networks sub tab.
:* Remove

==== Sub-Tabs ==== 

'''General'''  
* '''Fields'''- Name, Description, VM Network, VLAN tagging, MTU
[[File:NetworkTab.png|1200px]]
<br><br>
'''Clusters'''
* '''Columns'''- Name, Compatibility Version, Network Status, Network Assigned, Network Required, Network Role
* '''Actions'''
:*Assign/Unassign Network
[[File:assignNet.png]]
<br><br>
'''Hosts'''
<br>
Have a radio button that will show either
# All the hosts that this network is attached to
#* '''Columns'''- "Status image", Name, Cluster, Data Center, Status
#* '''Actions'''- Remove (detaches the network from the nic/bond on the host)
# All the hosts where this network attached to the cluster but not to the host (Very important for non-required where the host status does not indicate something is missing)
#* '''Columns'''- "Status image", Name, Cluster, Data Center, Status
#* '''Actions'''- SetupNetworks (link to SetupNetworks window)
<br>
'''Virtual Machines''' (default sub tab)
<br>
Have a radio button that will show either
# All the vms that this network is attached to
#* '''Columns'''- Name, ,nic (if more than one 'multiple'), Cluster, IP Address, Network, Status, Uptime
#* '''Actions'''- remove (multipule selection), remove from all
# All the vms where this network is not attached to
#* '''Columns'''- Name, Cluster, IP Address, Network, Status, Uptime
#* '''Actions'''- add (multiple selection)
<br><br>
'''Templates''' (same as vm)
* '''Columns'''- same as vm except IP Address and Uptime
* '''Actions'''- same as vm
<br>
'''Permissions'''
* '''Columns'''- User, Role, Inherited Permission
* '''Actions'''- Add, Remove

=== Search ===
'''Main Tab Search''' <br>
SearchType.Network - add relevant search command

'''Tree''' <br>
Networks:  1.2 Have a remove button for 1.1.1, ManageNetworks button for 1.1.2. Simple add will not do since you don't know where to add. 
*"Network: datacenter.name ='dcName'"
Network:  
* "Network: name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'"
* "Cluster: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'"
* "Host: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'"
* "Vms: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'"
* "Template: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'"

'''Search text area''' <br>
Network: (search by network properties)

=== Queries ===
'''Queries for the sub tabs'''
#Clusters - returns all the clusters the networks is attached to.
#Hosts- returns all the hosts the network is attached to one of their nics.
#Virtual Machines- returns all the vms that have at least one vnic on the network.
#Templates- returns all the templates that have at least one vnic on the network.
