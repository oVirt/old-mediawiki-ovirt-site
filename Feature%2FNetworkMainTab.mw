=== Detailed Description ===

==== User Experience ====
==== Tree ====

===== New items: =====
#'''Networks''' (a tree item under dc)
#* Displayed Tabs (the tabs that are displayed when the item is selected in the tree)- 
#** Networks (search criteria- "Network: datacenter.name = 'dcName'")
#* Children- all dc networks
# '''Network''' (a tree item under Networks, specific network name)
#* Displayed Tabs-
#** Networks (search criteria- "Network: name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'")
#** Clusters (search criteria- "Cluster: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'")
#** Hosts (search criteria- "Host: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'")
#** Virtual Machines (search criteria- "Vms: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'")
#** Templates (search criteria- "Template: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'")
#* Children - none

===== Selected items in the tree that show Networks tab: =====
* Networks
* Network
* Dc
* Cluster
* Host

<br><br>
'''Templates''' (tree of templates that has at least one vnic attached to the network, under each template- a list of the vnics attached to the network)
* '''Columns'''- Name (Can be expanded to show a list of the vnics the network is attached to), Status, Cluster, Data Center
* '''Actions'''- none
<br>
'''Permissions'''
* '''Columns'''- User, Role, Inherited Permission
* '''Actions'''- Add, Remove

=== Search ===
'''Main Tab Search''' <br>
SearchType.Network - add relevant search command

'''Tree''' <br>
Networks:
*"Network: datacenter.name ='dcName'"
Network:  
* "Network: name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'"
* "Cluster: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'"
* "Host: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'"
* "Vms: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'"
* "Template: network.name = 'treeSelectedNetName' datacenter.name = 'dcName'"

'''Search text area''' <br>
Network: (all combinations of search)

=== Queries ===
'''Queries for the sub tabs'''
#Clusters - returns all the clusters the networks is attached to.
#Hosts- returns all the hosts the network is attached to one of their nics.
#Virtual Machines- returns all the vms that have at least one vnic on the network.
