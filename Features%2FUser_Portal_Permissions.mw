== User Portal Permissions ==

=== Summary ===
This page details how the User Portal decides what objects to display, specifically in relation to create permissions.

=== Owner ===
* Name: [[User:Amureini|Allon Mureinik]]
* Email: amureini@redhat.com


=== Current status ===
* Target Release: 3.1
* Status: work in progress
* Last updated date: 10/05/2012


=== Detailed Description ===
==== Query Permissions and Integration with MLA ====
For each query the engine will manage <code>queryType</code>, which can be either an Admin query or a User query.
Admin query means only admins can execute the query, while User query means that any user can execute the query (administrators included).
In addition to the <code>queryType</code> a parameter, an <code>isFiltered</code> parameter will be added to the <code>VdcQueryParametersBase</code> class. 
This parameter will govern if the query is executed in filtered mode (and  should return only the objects the user has user permissions on) or not (and as such should return all the objects). The default is that <code>isFiltered</code> is set to <code>false</code>, due to backwards compatibility considerations.

Permission checking will be done in two levels:
# Autorization - before executing the query: validating a user is administrator if the query is Admin query or if `isFiltered` is set to false.
# Filtering  -as part of the query execution: joining the "business logic" of the query to a permissions view, providing a single point of entry to managing permission logic.

==== VdcQueryType enum ====
A property <code>queryType</code> will be added to the enum.
Most queries are not available to users so the default will be <code>admin</code>.

==== VdcQueryParametersBase ====
From now on, it will be possible to specify if the query should be executed in admin or in filtered mode. The default will be to execute as admin, for backwards compatibility reasons.

==== Running a Query ====
In case of an admin query (be it due to the query's internal type or to a request to run as an admin), the query will perform a minimal autorization check to see if the user may execute such queries.

==== DAOs ====
Each method used by a user query will be overloaded with two additional parameters - userID and isFiltered.
E.g., we would like to have a filtered version of <code>GetVmInterfacesByVmIdQuery</code>, which uses <code>VmNetworkInterfaceDAO.getAllForVm(Guid vmID)</code>, so we will overload this method and create <code>VmNetworkInterfaceDAO.getAllForVm(Guid vmID, Guid userID, boolean isFiltered)</code>.

===== Hibernate DAO implementations =====
Currently, will not be supported.
If necessary, an additional method that throws <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code>, and a test that verifies this exception is thrown
so when the Hibernate DAO will be implemented that test will break, and the implementor will  remember to implement this method too.

==== Permissions Views ====
A set of n flat views (one per entity type) will be created. 
The view will hold the userid and entity_id and fields will implement the flattened logic of permissions.
E.g., if it's decided that permissions on pool grant read permissions on the VMs inside it, this will be exposed in the <code>vm_permissions_view</code> view.
Each query implementation will be responsible for joining with the appropriate permissions view.
Thus, permissioning logic will only be implemented in a single place (per type, unfortunately) instead of inside each query.

==== Stored Procedures ====
Each stored procedure used by a user query will have two parameters added to it - <code>user_id (UUID)</code> and <code>is_filtered (boolean)</code>.

==== Inheriting Permissions ====
Today, the User Portal exposes all the objects under an entity if any permission is given on that entity or on the reflecting entities (add link to explanation what is reflecting entities).
This behaviour is correct for "manipulate" and "use" permission, but not for "create" permissions.
E.g. If a user has the permissions to create a VM in a cluster, he sould not be able to see all the VMs in that cluster.

In the suggested solution, an additional column, "is_inherited" (boolean) will be added to the roles_groups table. Only action grousp with is_inherited=true will provide permissions on the objects contained in the object they are granted on.

Following is a detailed description of the behavior for each entity type.
* Data Center - Create VM/Template permission will not grant the ability to view VMs/Templates in the DC.
* Cluster - Create VM/Template permission will not grant the ability to view VMs/Templates in the cluser.
* Storage Domain - Create VM/Template/Disk permission will not grant the ability to view objcets contained in the storage domain.

===== Creartor Roles =====
Two new predefined roles should be added - VM Creator and Tempalate Creator, which only contain the action groups for adding VMs/Templates, respectively, and do not allow users to manipulate existing entities.
These new roles will be the way administrators will grant their users the ability to create new VMs/Templates without exposing existing ones.

===== Template Operator Role =====
A new predifined role should be added - Template Operator.
This role will allow the modification of an existing template, and would be given to a user who issues a CreateVMTempalteCommand on the template he created.

==== Entity Description ====
No new entities are required for this feature.

==== CRUD ====
No new entities are required for this feature.

==== User Experience ====
See Inheriting Permissions.

==== Installation/Upgrade ====
The three new predifined roles should be created.

==== User work-flows ====
===== Adding a VM =====
1. The admin grants the VM Creator permission to a user on a host/cluster
2. The user can create a new VM on the host/cluster
3. Once the user creates the VM, he becomes a VM Operator on this VM

==== Events ====
No new events are added.

= Writing a New User Query =

== What Are User Queries? ==
User queries are, in a nutshell, queries that can be run a regular user, without requiring admin permissions.

== The General Case ==

In the general case, your query will call one of the DAOs, which, in turn, will call a stored procedure in the database.
When writing a User Query, there are several aspects you must address.

=== Permission View ===
Each entity with managed permissions has its own flattened view of user permissions called user_OBJECT_NAME_permissions_view (e.g., VM permissions are listed in user_vm_permissions_view).
Notes:
 1. The view only lists '''user''' permissions.  A user that has administrator permissions on an object will not be represented here.
 1. The view flattens object hierarchies. E.g., if a user should be able to query a VM since he has permissions on the Storage Pool containing it, that user permission will appear in the VM view. You do not have to handle it yourself.
 1. The view flattens group hierarchies. E.g., if a user should be able to query a VM since a group he's contained in has permissions on the VM, that user permission will appear in the VM view. You do not have to handle it yourself.

=== Stored Procedure ===
The stored procedure should, besides the parameters involved in the query's logic, contain two more parameters - {{{user_id}}} (UUID) and a BOOLEAN {{{is_filtered}}} flag.
If {{{is_filtered}}} is {{{TRUE}}} only the objects the user has permissions on should be returned. If it's {{{FALSE}}}, the {{{user_id}}} should be ignored.

The query inside the stored procedure should have a part of the where clause which represents this, as follows:
{{{#!sql
Create or replace FUNCTION GetImagesByVmGuid(v_vm_guid UUID, v_user_id UUID, v_is_filtered BOOLEAN)
RETURNS SETOF vm_images_view
   AS $procedure$
BEGIN
      RETURN QUERY SELECT *
      FROM vm_images_view
      WHERE
      vm_guid = v_vm_guid
      AND (NOT v_is_filtered OR EXISTS (SELECT 1
                                        FROM   user_vm_permissions_view
                                        WHERE  user_id = v_user_id AND entity_id = v_vm_guid));

END; $procedure$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
}}}


=== DAO ===
The DAO should contain two overloaded methods - one with the {{{userID}}} and {{{isFiltered}}} parameters and one without, which assumes its run as an administrator and passes {{{null}}} and {{{false}}}, respectively, to the first flavor.

e..g:
{{{#!java
@Override
public List<DiskImage> getAllForVm(Guid id) {
    return getAllForVm(id, null, false);
}

@Override
public List<DiskImage> getAllForVm(Guid id, Guid userID, boolean isFiltered) {
    MapSqlParameterSource parameterSource = getCustomMapSqlParameterSource()
            .addValue("vm_guid", id).addValue("user_id", userID).addValue("is_filtered", isFiltered);

    return groupImagesStorage(getCallsHandler().executeReadList("GetImagesByVmGuid",
                fullDiskImageRowMapper,
                parameterSource));
}
}}}


=== Query ===
The {{{userID}}} parameter is available by the {{{getUserID()}}} method. 
The {{{isFiltered}}} parameter is available from the query paramters by the {{{isFiltered()}}} method.

e.g.:
{{{#!java
@Override
protected void executeQueryCommand() {
    getQueryReturnValue().setReturnValue(
        DbFacade.getInstance().getDiskImageDAO().getAllForVm
                                (getParameters().getVmId(), getUserID(), getParameters().isFiltered()));
}
}}}

=== VdcQueryType ===
In order for your new query to be treated as a User Query, add a new entry for it in the VdcQueryType enum, with the optional {{{VdcQueryAuthType.User}}} parameter.
e.g.:
{{{#!java
...
GetAllDisksByVmId(VdcQueryAuthType.User),
...
}}}

==== Testing your Query ====

A test case should be written for each new query.
You should extend {{{AbstractUserQueryTest}}}, and thus recieve the following services:
 1. {{{getQuery()}}} - returns the query to use in the test, with a mocked up user
 1. {{{getQueryParameters()}}} - return '''a mock''' parameter object the query was constructed with. You can add additional behavior to it using {{{when(...).thenRerurn(...)}}} statements.
 1. {{{getUser()}}} - returns the mocked user running the query
 1. {{{getDbFacadeMockInstance()}}} - returns a power-mocked instance of {{{DbFacade}}}. You can add additional behavior to it (e.g., adding mocks for specific DAOs) using {{{when(...).thenRerurn(...)}}} statements.
 1. {{{testQueryIsAUserQuery()}}} - tests your query was indeed marked as a user query. Is run from the base class, and does not need to be called explicitly.


== Queries with a User ID as a parameter ==

These queries essentially filter their results according to user ID in any case, so no special database treatment is needed.
However, there is a mechanism that assures a user that does not have admin permissions could not initiate such a query with a different user's ID,

=== Query ===
Simply extend the {{{GetDataByUserIDQueriesBase}}} class.
It's {{{executeQueryCommand()}}} already implements the logic detailed above, so you should not override it.
Instead, it provides two methods for this logic:
 1. getPrivilegedQueryReturnValue() - the value the query returns in case the user has privileges to execute it (i.e., is an admin or is querying his own objects). Should be implemented in your query.
 1. getUnprivilegedQueryReturnValue()  - the value the query returns in case the user does not have privileges to execute it (i.e., isn't an admin and isn't querying his own objects). The default implementation returns an empty list.

e.g.:
{{{#!java
@Override
protected List<vm_pools> getPrivilegedQueryReturnValue() {
    return DbFacade.getInstance().getVmPoolDAO().getAllForUser(getParameters().getUserId());
}
}}}
