tip for monitoring the IRC channel:

* - pidgin users: configure the "nick said" plugin and in the options fill in "Words to highlight on" words like <BR>
vm, pool, migrate, migration, guest and so on. 

* - konversation users:

# Prepare yourself a short list of keywords. see the suggestion above.
# Open Konversation -> Settings -> Configure Konversation
# There's a tree on the left side. Choose Highlight.
# Add your key words, enable sound if you can.
