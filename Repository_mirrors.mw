=Mirroring oVirt repositories=

Do you want to become a mirror? Do you have some bandwidth to spare?

Drop us a line at [mailto:infra@ovirt.org infa] and tell us about yourself! You just need to pass us a public ssh key, and once set up you'll be able to rsync from our site with the following command:

  rsync -rltHvvzP mirror@resources.ovirt.org:/var/www/html destination/dir

After some validation we will add your site to this page and to the mirrorlist!

'''Thanks a lot for your bandwidth!'''

=For admins=

We have a simple setup to allow mirroring of the oVirt repositories. Right now the mirroring is done through ssh with rsync. You'll find in '''resources.ovirt.org''' a user named '''mirror''', that's the user that the mirrors should use, you'll see that it has a lot of entries under ''~/.ssh/authorized_keys'', there each entry is restricted to run only a specific command that allows them to rsync the repo directory.

==Adding a mirror==

To add a mirror you just need to add it's public ssh key in  ''~mirror/.ssh/authorized_keys'', with the command restriction as the other entries. Then when the mirror is confirmed you can add it to the mirrorlist (''resources.ovirt.org:/var/www/html/pub/yum-repo/mirrorlist'') and to this wiki.
