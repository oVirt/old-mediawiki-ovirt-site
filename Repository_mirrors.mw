=Mirroring oVirt repositories=

We have a simple setup to allow mirroring of the oVirt repositories. Right now the mirroring is done through ssh with rsync. You'll find in '''resources.ovirt.org''' a user named '''mirror''', that's the user that the mirrors should use, you'll see that it has a lot of entries under ''~/.ssh/authorized_keys'', there each entry is restricted to run only a specific command that allows them to rsync the respo directory.

=Adding a mirror=

To add a mirror you just need to add it's public ssh key in  ''~mirror/.ssh/authorized_keys'', with the command restriction as the other entries. Then when the mirror is confirmed you can add it to the mirrorlist (''/var/www/html/pub/yum-repo/mirrorlist'') and to this wiki.

After the key is added, you should be able to rsync from it using the command:

  rsync -rltHvvzP mirror@linode01.ovirt.org:/var/www/html destination/dir
