{{DISPLAYTITLE:oVirt 3.5 Test Day}}

==Objective==
* engage project users and stakeholders to a hands-on experiences with oVirt new release.
* improve the quality of oVirt.
* Introduce and validate new oVirt 3.5 features.

==What I should do==
* If you already have the hardware, verify if it meets the hardware requirement, refer to information detail section below.
* Write down the configuration you used (HW, console, etc) and what you've tested in the [http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.5-testday-3 third test day report etherpad] (previous is [http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.5-testday-1 first test day report etherpad;  [http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.5-testday-2 second test day report etherpad]]).
* Go ahead and  [[oVirt_3.5_TestDay#Installation_notes| install ovirt ]].
* Follow the documentation to setup your environment, and test drive the new features.
* Please remember we expect to see some issues, and anything you come up with will save you when you'll install final release.
* Remember to try daily tasks you'd usually do in the engine, to see there are no regressions.
* Accomplish the goals set in objective section ,  run the tests,  update the test matrix.
* Running into any issues?
**  [[Community | Try to get help from the community ]] on #ovirt IRC channel or
**  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=oVirt open a bugzilla] ticket or
**  Report it on the [http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.5-testday-3 third test day report etherpad] (previous is [http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.5-testday-1 first test day report etherpad], [http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.5-testday-2 second test day report etherpad] ).

==Installation notes==

* Make sure you have one of the following distributions installed on your machine:
** Fedora 19
** Fedora 20
** CentOS 6.5
** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5
** Any other distribution based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5
* Follow installation instructions provided within [[OVirt_3.5_Release_Notes#Fedora_.2F_CentOS_.2F_RHEL|oVirt 3.5 Release Notes]]

===Known issues===

* Fedora 19 hosts: you'll need libvirt >= 1.0.1 to use cluster level 3.5 . This is provided in the virt-preview repo, enabled automatically by installing the ovirt-release35.rpm as explained in the [[OVirt_3.5_Release_Notes#Fedora_.2F_CentOS_.2F_RHEL|oVirt 3.5 Release Notes]]
* DWH/Reports setup is currently broken.
* You can't refresh iso file list after adding a host, see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1114499 for a workaround.
* The beta RPM packages are not signed. Either use 'yum --nogpgcheck' or set 'gpgcheck=0' in the repo file.
* CentOS hosts don't report RNG devices sources. Please uncheck '/dev/random' checkbox in Cluster Options for default cluster before adding any CentOS host to it.

==oVirt 3.5 New Features  - Test Status Table==
Please report test results on the [http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.5-testday-3 third test day report etherpad] (previous is [http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.5-testday-1 first test day report etherpad]; [http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.5-testday-2 second test day report etherpad]).or on the table below.

Following tests should be performed on all supported distributions.

==Regression testing==

===General===
You need at least two physical servers to install and configure a basic yet complete oVirt environment with shared storage to exercise the following:

===Hosted Engine===
You need at least two physical servers to install and configure a basic yet complete oVirt environment with shared storage to exercise the following tests.
You may need to read the following documents:
* [[Features/Self Hosted Engine Maintenance Flows|Unify maintenance path of Hosted Engine with host maintenance]]
* [[Hosted Engine Howto|Hosted Engine on NFS]]

===Configuration===

===Infra===


===Storage===


===Network===
* Important Note: Known Fedora 19 bug: If the ovirtmgmt bridge is not successfully installed during initial host-setup, manually click on the host, setup networks, and add the ovirtmgmt bridge.
*Base config - single NIC, bridge on top, VMs attached to NIC
*Advanced configurations:
[[File:Vlan bonding.jpg]]
Make sure each of the configs can:
*Survive a reboot
*Test network at both host and VM level
*Ping and transfer large amounts of data (2Gb size files should be enough)
*Remain operational over time (1hr of uptime should be sufficient for the basic testing)

===Tools===
*Basic operations on iso-uploader:
 # '''engine-iso-uploader list'''
 # '''engine-iso-uploader upload <iso> -i <iso-domain-name> -v -f'''
* Advanced operations on iso-uploader: try different arguments, see full list with
 # '''engine-iso-uploader --help'''

* Basic operations on log-collector:
 # '''engine-log-collector list'''
 # '''engine-log-collector collect'''
* Advanced operations on log-collector : try different arguments, see full list with
 # '''engine-log-collector --help'''

*Basic operation on image-uploader
 # '''engine-image-uploader list'''
 # '''engine-image-uploader --name=<new name here> -e <domain> upload my.ovf'''
* Advanced operations on image-uploader: try different arguments, see full list with
 # '''engine-image-uploader --help'''
