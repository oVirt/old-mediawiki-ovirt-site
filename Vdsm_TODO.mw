= What Can You Do for Vdsm =

* <tt>pylint -E `git ls-files | grep '.py$'`</tt> makes me cry. A lot of it is "only" about bad style, but we should clear it up and add it to our <tt>make check-local</tt>. We should grow up and pass <tt>pychecker</tt> too.

* Improve Vdsm portability. We are very much Fedora-centric at best. Do you want to have Vdsm on your pet distribution? Own that port!

* Simplify the SysV init script, split most of its code to a "[http://gerrit.ovirt.org/295 vdsm-tool]".

* Support striping for disk images.

* remove all usage of <tt>sudo</tt>, and replace with specific calls to <tt>superVdsm</tt>.

* have a logrotate-dependent logrotate.conf that works on Fedora and EL equally well.

* let Vdsm install and run on hosts with no iscsid (report that iscsi is missing to Engine?)
