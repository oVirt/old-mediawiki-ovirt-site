= What Can You Do for Vdsm =

== Cleanup ==
* <tt>pylint -E `git ls-files | grep '.py$'`</tt> makes me cry. A lot of it is "only" about bad style, but we should clear it up and add it to our <tt>make check-local</tt>. We should grow up and pass <tt>pychecker</tt> too.

* Improve Vdsm portability. We are very much Fedora-centric at best. Do you want to have Vdsm on your pet distribution? Own that port!

* remove all usage of <tt>sudo</tt>, and replace with specific calls to <tt>superVdsm</tt>.

* have a logrotate-dependent logrotate.conf that works on Fedora and EL equally well.

* Configure vdsm to use syslog -- done by Mark Wu, but now we need to stop trashing the console.

* Simplify the SysV init script, split most of its code to a "[http://gerrit.ovirt.org/295 vdsm-tool]". vdsm-tool should assume responsibility on hairy stuff such as [http://bugzilla.redhat.com/547424 configuring multipath], which should not be the business of Vdsm proper.

* running vdsClient from the project root dir ends with tears. Some PYTHONPATH games should fix this.

== Testing ==
* <strike>write an automatic script that runs on each and every new change to gerrit, and adds an insulting comment if <tt>pyflakes</tt> fails for the new change.</strike> Thanks, Robert!

* extend the former script, so that it runs a complete <tt>`make distcheck && make install`</tt> in a confined environment (chroot, VM) and reports if there is an error.

* run unit and functional tests on reviewed patches (before submission).

== Features ==
* Support striping for disk images.

* let Vdsm install and run on hosts with no iscsid (report that iscsi is missing to Engine?)

* add hooks for device hotplug

* add hooks for network operations

== refactoring ==
* In vm.py, libvirtvm.py, clientIF.py  there is a mess of prepare*Path functions (end their respective teardowns), which is too complex to fathom. We have to convert all drive specifications (PDIV,GUID,path) into Drive object at the API entry.

* lvm.PV.guid is devicemapper-owned piece of information; lvm has nothing to do with it, and jumps through [http://gerrit.ovirt.org/2940 hoops] to produce it. Instead, it should be produced by devicemapper and consumed directly by blockSD.

* Define an API.VMState "enumeration" and use API.VMState.UP instead of the string 'Up'.

* factor betterPopen and betterThreading out of vdsm. They deserve a pipy review under the names cPopen and [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pthreading pthreading] respectively.

== Bugzilla ==

* pick one of the [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?action=wrap&bug_file_loc=&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_id=&bug_id_type=anyexact&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&component=vdsm&deadlinefrom=&deadlineto=&email1=&email2=&emailtype1=substring&emailtype2=substring&field0-0-0=flagtypes.name&keywords=&keywords_type=allwords&longdesc=&longdesc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard=&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&type0-0-0=notsubstring&value0-0-0=rhel-6.2.0&votes=&=&bug_status=NEW NEW bugs], post a patch to [http://gerrit.ovirt.org gerrit], and make the bug yours.
