=== Summary ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
Currently SR-IOV in oVirt is only supported using vdsm-hook [http://www.ovirt.org/VDSM-Hooks/sriov].
This feature adds SR-IOV support to oVirt management system.

=== Current status ===
[http://wiki.ovirt.org/Feature/DetailedSRIOV SR-IOV Detailed Design]
* Last update date: 09/09/2014

=== Introduction ===
SR-IOV enables a Single Root Function (for example, a single Ethernet port), to appear as multiple, separate, physical devices.
SR-IOV uses two PCI functions: 
* Physical Functions (PFs)-  Full PCIe device that includes the SR-IOV capabilities. 
* Virtual Functions (VFs)- ’lightweight’ PCIe functions that contain the resources necessary for data movement but have a carefully minimized set of configuration resources.
VM's nic (vNic) can be connected directly to a VF (1-1) instead of to virtual network bridge (vm network). Bypassing the  virtual networking devices on the host reduces latency and CPU utilization.<br>

==== High Level Feature Description ====
In order to connect a vnic directly to a sr-iov enabled nic the vnic should be marked as a passthrough.
The properties that should be configured on the VF are taken from the vnic's profile/network ( vlan, mtu, qos, custom properties ((open issue- what properties are supported?))).
When starting the vm the vnic will be directly connected to one of the availiable VFs on the host's sr-iov enabled nic (the nic that the vnic's network is attached to).

==== Affected Flows ====
=====  add/edit network =====
* <b>passthrough </b>
**  new property that will be added to the network.
** passthrough property cannot be changed on edit network.
** If the network is passthrough, just passthrough supported properties can be edited in the network (open issue- what properties?).
* A network can be defined as- vm network <b>or</b> passthrough network <b>or</b> none.
* (open issue- is label on passthrough network supported?)

===== add/edit profile =====
* If the profiles network is passthrough, just passthrough supported properties can be edited in the profile (open issue- what properties?).

===== add/update network on cluster =====
* (open issue- should passthrough network be always required?).
* (open issue- can passthrough network be management, display or migration network).

===== add/edit vNic =====
* <b>passthrough </b>
**  new property that will be added to the vnic.
** it means that the vnic will bypass the software network virtualization and will be connected  directly to the VF. (what about ucs- vm fex- should it have a separate passthrough property or should the technology (vm fex or sr-iov) should be transparent to the user at this stage?)
** it will be supported just for <b>virtio</b> vnic type
*<b>vnic profile/network</b>
** just networks that are marked as 'passthrough' are allowed to be configured on 'passthrough' vnic.
** represents set of properties that will be applied on the vf (open issue: what properties are supported ? vlan, MTU, QoS, custom properties).
** (open issue- is empty profile permitted on passthrough vnic)
** (open issue- maybe it is enough that the selected network on a vnic is passthrough and there is no need for passthrough property on the vnic).

===== hot plug nic =====
* <b>plugging</b>
** hot plug of passthough vnic is possible if there is available VF on the PF. 
* <b>unplugging</b>
** if the vnic is pasthrough the VF will be released (deleted?)

===== vnic linking =====
* <b>linking</b>
** linking of passthough vnic is possible if there is available VF on the PF. 
* <b>unlinking</b>
** if the vnic is pasthrough the VF will be released (deleted?)

===== run vm =====
* if there is no are no nics that support sr-iov on the host? if there are no available VFs? 

=====  network labelling =====
* (open issue- is it supported on passthrough networks?)

===== setup networks =====
* <b>max_vfs</b>
** max_vfs is a new propery that will be added to host nic. 
** editing the propery
*** setting 0
****  means sr-iov will not be enabled for this nic
**** if there are passthrough networks attached to it the will be automatically detached
***** if there are running vms on the host that are using those networks the operation (of changing max_vfs to 0) will fail.
*** setting other value than 0
**** enables sr-iov on the physical nic.
**** if sr-iov is not supported on the physical nic, the operation will fail with explanation error message.
**** limits the number of its VFs to max_vfs value.
**** if the updated value is bigger than the max_vfs that can be supported by the physical nic, the operation will fail with explanation error message.
**** (open issue- consider having max_vfs and sriov_supported properties on the nic host, so the user won't have to wait for the error message to see there is a problem).
* <b>passthrough network</b>
** can be attached just to sr-iov enabled nic (nic with max_vfs > 0 set on it).
** passthrough networks with and without vlan can co-exist together on the same sr-iov enabled nic.
*<b>regular network</b>
** regular network can be attached to a sr-iov enabled nic (also if there are passthrough networks attached to it).
** the logic for the co-exsistence of regular networks on the same nic won't be changed- passthrough networks will be ignored in this validation.
*<b>label on sr-iov enabled nic</b>
** (open issue- is it supported?)
* bonding of sr-iov enable nics- no supported (?).
* setting max_vfs on a bond- no supported (?).
* setting boot-protocol on passthrough network is not supported.

=====run vm =====
*<b>scheduling host</b>
** if the vm has passthrough vnic, the physical nic to which the vnic's network is attached to is being checked
*** if it has more than max_vfs running vms connected to its VFs the host is filtered out from the scheduling.
** if all the hosts were filtered out from the scheduling the running of the VM will fail and an appropriate error message will be displayed.
* just on run vm the relevant VF will be created and configured with the network configuration values. (???)

===== migration =====
* scheduling the host- same as run vm.
* the network configuration values will be set on the VFs of the scheduled host before the migration takes place. (???)

==== User Experience ====

==== REST API ====
* <b>setup networks</b>
** should VF be sent as a separate nic?

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
* Configuration of vnics in 'passthrough' mode directly from the gui/rest without the need of using  vdsm-hook [http://www.ovirt.org/VDSM-Hooks/sriov]
* Configuring max-vfs on a sr-iov enabled host nic via setup networks.
* (migration of vms using sr-iov?)

=== Comments and Discussion ===

=== Open issues ===
*  what properties can be configured on VF- vlan, MTU, QoS, custom properties?
* is empty profile permitted on passthrough vnic?
* maybe it is enough that the selected network on a vnic is passthrough and there is no need for passthrough property on the vnic.
* should passthrough network be always required?
* can passthrough network be management, display or migration network?
* consider having max_vfs and sriov_supported properties on the nic host, so the user won't have to wait for the error message to see there is a problem.
* there is an issue that the mac address of a VF is  re-generated after each host reboot.
* are labels on sr-iov enabled nic supported?
* is label on passthrough  network supported?
* unplug/unlink passthrough vnic- should the VF be just released or should be deleted?
