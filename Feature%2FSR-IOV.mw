=== Summary ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
Currently SR-IOV in oVirt is only supported using vdsm-hook [http://www.ovirt.org/VDSM-Hooks/sriov].
This feature adds SR-IOV support to oVirt management system.

=== Current status ===
[http://wiki.ovirt.org/Feature/DetailedSRIOV SR-IOV Detailed Design]
* Last update date: 09/09/2014

=== Introduction ===
SR-IOV enables a Single Root Function (for example, a single Ethernet port), to appear as multiple, separate, physical devices.
SR-IOV uses two PCI functions: 
* Physical Functions (PFs)-  Full PCIe device that includes the SR-IOV capabilities. 
* Virtual Functions (VFs)- ’lightweight’ PCIe functions that contain the resources necessary for data movement but have a carefully minimized set of configuration resources.
A VM's vNic can be connected directly to a VF (1-1) instead of to virtual network bridge (vm network).

==== High Level Feature Description ====
In order to connect a vnic directly to a sr-iov enabled nic the vnic should be marked as a passthrough.
The properties that should be configured on the vf are taken from the vnic's profile/network ( vlan, mtu, qos, custom properties).
When starting the vm the vnic will be directly connected to one of the availiable vfs on the host's sr-iov enabled nic (the nic that the vnic's network is attached to).

==== Affected Flows ====
==== <b> add/edit network</b> ====
* If the network is passthrough, just passthrough supported properties can be edited in the network (open issue- what properties?).
* passthrough property cannot be changed on edit network.
==== <b> add/edit profile</b> ====
* If the profiles network is passthrough, just passthrough supported properties can be edited in the profile (open issue- what properties?).
==== <b> add/edit vNic</b> ====
* <b>passthrough </b>
**  new property that will be added to the vnic.
** it means that the vnic will bypass the software network virtualization and will be connected  directly to the vf. (what should happen if the are no nics that support sr-iov on the host? if there are no available vfs? what about ucs- vm fex- should it have a separate passthrough property or should the technology (vm fex or sr-iov) should be transparent to the user at this stage?)
** it will be supported just for <b>virtio</b> vnic type
*<b>vnic profile/network</b>
** just networks that are marked as 'passthrough' are allowed to be configured on 'passthrough' vnic.
** represents set of properties that will be applied on the vf (open issue: what properties are supported ? vlan, mtu, qos, custom properties)
** required/non required

==== <b>hot plug nic</b> ====

==== <b>vnic linking</b> ====

==== <b>run vm</b> ====

==== <b> network labeling </b> ====

** if a vnic has passthrough property 

==== <b>setup networks</b> ====

==== <b>migration</b> ====

==== User Experience ====

==== REST API ====

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
* Configuration of vnics in 'passthrough' mode directly from the gui/rest without the need of using  vdsm-hook [http://www.ovirt.org/VDSM-Hooks/sriov]
* Configuring max-vfs on a sr-iov enabled host nic via setup networks.
* (migration of vms using sr-iov?)
