* Last update date: 09/09/2014

=== Introduction ===
SR-IOV enables a Single Root Function (for example, a single Ethernet port), to appear as multiple, separate, physical devices.
SR-IOV uses two PCI functions: 
* Physical Functions (PFs)-  Full PCIe device that includes the SR-IOV capabilities. 
* Virtual Functions (VFs)- ’lightweight’ PCIe functions that contain the resources necessary for data movement but have a carefully minimized set of configuration resources.
A VM's vNic can be connected directly to a VF (1-1) instead of to virtual network bridge (vm network).
