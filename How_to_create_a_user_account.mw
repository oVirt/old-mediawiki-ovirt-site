If you would like to make changes to wiki pages, follow the "Log in" link at the top of any page, and [[Special:RequestAccount | request a new account]]. There may be some delay in creating your account - if you would like to hurry us up a little, ask for help [[Communication#IRC | on the oVirt IRC channel]] or [[Communication#Mailing_lists | on the Users mailing list]]

Once you have your user account, read [[Help:Editing]] and the related content in the [[:Category:Documentation for writing on the wiki]].
