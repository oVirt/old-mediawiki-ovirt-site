'''''Account creation is moderated by the wiki administrators - once you request an account, and confirm your email address, it will be created for you as quickly as possible. We are protecting this wiki from spambots and bad actors.'''''

If you would like to make changes to wiki pages, do this:

# Follow the [[Special:UserLogin|Log in]] link at the top of any page;
# Click on [[Special:RequestAccount|request a new account]].
#* (You may also click on the above link to go directly there.)

There may be some delay in creating your account - if you would like to hurry us up a little, ask for help [[Communication#IRC | on the oVirt IRC channel]] or [[Communication#Mailing_lists | on the Users mailing list]]

Once you have your user account, read [[Help:Editing]] and the related content in the [[:Category:Documentation for writing on the wiki]].
