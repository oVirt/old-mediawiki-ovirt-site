=== Detailed Description ===
CPU is one of the important component which each guest has.

Currently RHEV doesn't support SLA features which limits guest's
and qemu's cpu resource consumption. Therefore all guests working
on the same host may be affected by other guests' cpu workload.

On the other hand, customers expect that virtualized systems work as
stably as the systems on bare servers.

To provide same stability in virtualized environment, we need to limit
cpu bandwidth of each guest and isolate each guest from others.

=== GUI ===

The user will configure the CPU limitation at the VM popup, at the advance Resource Allocation section: <br>
