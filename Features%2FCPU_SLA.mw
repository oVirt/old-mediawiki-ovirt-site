=== Detailed Description ===
When running a VM, the VM should run as an independent unit and should be affected by other VMs as little as possible.
This feature enable the user to limit the CPU resources of a specific VM, this will ensure that in cases were several VMs are running on the same host, one VM will not cause performance decline in another VMs.
Another good use for this feature is in cases a growth in the number of VMs is expected, the user can limit the CPU resource to a VM leaving enough CPU resources for the future VMs, this way users of the guest will not have an impact on performance once other VMs will join the host.
