== Separate Reports Host ==

{{Feature|name=Separate Reports Host|modules=engine|status=Design|version=3.5.0}}

=== Summary ===
Allow ovirt-engine-reports to be installed and configured by engine-setup on a separate machine, without requiring ovirt-engine or DWH to be on the same host.

=== Current status ===
In preparation.

=== Detailed Description ===

We assume that engine is already setup and running on machine A. We assume that dwh is already setup and running on machine B. A and B can be same machine. We assume that user wants to install reports on machine C.

We need access to the engine's database and to dwh's database. We'll let the user choose between two options:
* provide root password of machine B, ssh there, get the credentials
* manually supply the credentials

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Reports might cause significant load on the engine machine. Installing it on a separate machine will allow distributing the load.

Some installations might want to separate for security reasons, e.g. to give some users access only to Reports and not to the engine web admin.

=== Testing ===

Install and setup ovirt-engine on machine A, ovirt-engine-dwh on machine B (A and B might be the same machine), ovirt-engine-reports on machine C, see that the reports application on C shows data from the engine on machine A collected by DWH on machine B.
