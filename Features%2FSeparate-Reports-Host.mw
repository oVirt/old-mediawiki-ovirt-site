== Separate Reports Host ==

{{Feature|name=Separate Reports Host|modules=engine|status=Planning|version=3.5.0}}

=== Summary ===
Allow ovirt-engine-reports to be installed and configured by engine-setup on a separate machine, without requiring ovirt-engine or DWH to be on the same host.

=== Current status ===
In preparation.

=== Detailed Description ===
TBD:
* Need access to the engine's database - if db is setup locally, we might ask the user for the root password and ssh to get the credentials
* Need access to the DWH database - if db is setup locally, we might ask the user for the root password and ssh to get the credentials
* We might want to try and understand that from some engine status page first, to not bother the user. Do we need the engine's FQDN for other things?

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Reports might cause significant load on the engine machine. Installing it on a separate machine will allow distributing the load.

Some installations might want to separate for security reasons, e.g. to give some users access only to Reports and not to the engine web admin.

=== Testing ===

Install and setup ovirt-engine on machine A, ovirt-engine-dwh on machine B (A and B might be the same machine), ovirt-engine-reports on machine C, see that the reports application on C shows data from the engine on machine A collected by DWH on machine B.
