== Expose VM Devices ==

=== Summary ===

We would like to allow the user to see more information regarding the devices that attached to a vm.<BR>
VM devices are mostly virtual hardware devices used in the vm,<BR>
like controllers, PCI cards and more.

=== Current Status ===

* Status: Design
* Target release: 3.6

=== Detailed Description ===

currently (oVirt 3.5), only some of the device are visible to the user,<BR>
and also for these devices not all information is exposed.

some examples:<BR>
on add/edit vm, user can select to use sound, display device, smart-card and more.<BR>
Still the user cannot see the controllers used for these devices,<BR>
and more information on every device like address, type in the system and other information that stored in the system.
<BR><BR>
''' Implementation '''<BR>
VM devices are widely used in the ovirt engine, but merely exposed in UI and API,<BR>
The idea of this feature is to allow users to see more information of devices,<BR>
and prepare the ground for future work, like allowing setting device address and more.<BR>
<BR>
for every device we will show:
 * icon per type
 * Type: like USB, Controller, Disk...
 * address
 * boot order
 * plugged
 * readonly
 * engine managed
 * spec params

==== UI ====
Add new sub tab for VMs and Templates: Devices<BR>
This sub tab will contain a list of all VM devices<BR>
need to consider what actions (if any) we would like to have in the new sub tab.<BR>


==== REST API ====
Add new sub collection for VMs and Templates: Devices<BR>
This will be a collection of all VM devices

=== UI Mock-Ups ===
* sub tab view with icons for devices

=== Open Issues ===
*Expose "grouping" of devices? 
today in the engine db we have "general" type that can be used,<BR>
for example: Disk, Floppy and CD are all of general-type "Disk"<BR>
and sound,ac97,ich6 are sound<BR>
but some has no group, like smartcard,watchdog, etc..
<BR>
another option for grouping is analyzing the address,<BR>
and group with "pci","ide" and so.<BR>
the downside of this approach is that it is very general,<BR>
and probably most devices will just be PCI and it will be useless<BR>
another issue is that address is available only after the vm was run.<BR>
