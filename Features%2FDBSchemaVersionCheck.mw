=== Detailed Description ===

The engine schema contains the '''schema_version''' table that holds information on upgrade scripts and their installation status. <BR>
As both clean install and upgrade run these scripts, and any schema change is performed by adding another upgrade script it is crucial to keep <BR>
version information about the upgrade scripts in order to make sure unchanged scripts will not be re-run when upgrade process is being re-run. <BR>
In order to maintain the version for a given upgrade script, for each upgrade script the md5 calculation of its content is kept in the above mentioned DB.<BR><BR>

The table description is as follows: <BR>
| Column Name  | Column Type  | Null? |   Definition                                                    |  index/pk/fk |<BR>
| id           | int          | No    |   Version ID                                                    | PK           |<BR>
| version      | varchar(10)  | No    |   The version of the schema the upgrade script tried to acieve  |              |<BR>
| script       | varchar(255) | No    |   The script file name                                          |              |<BR>
| checksum     | varchar(128) | No    |   md5 of the script file                                        |              |<BR>
| installed_by | varchar(30)  | No    |   The db user that runs the upgrade script                      |              |<BR>
| started_at   | timestamp    | No    |   Script start time                                             |              |<BR>
| ended_at     | timestamp    | Yes   |   Script end time                                               |              |<BR>

| current      | boolean      | No    |   true only for last version installed successfully             |              |<BR>


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
If we look at snapshots as "checkpoints" of VM state + data , and "checkpoints" are made in significant points of time, the feature allows a user to create a VM based on a significant point of time of another VM, and use the cloned VM, without interfering with the original VM (i.e - no need to perform collapse on images of the source VM).
