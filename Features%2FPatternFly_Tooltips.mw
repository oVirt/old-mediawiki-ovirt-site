== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
As part of our transition to a PatternFly-based UI, we are converting all tooltips in the oVirt web applications to use PatternFly (Bootstrap-based) tooltips.

Previously oVirt used a combination of blue panel-based homegrown tooltips, and html title-based tooltips. The look was disjointed. This effort will clean that up and make everything look uniform.

== Benefit to oVirt ==
Both oVirt users and administrators will benefits from a superior user experience. Developers will benefit from a simplified and easy to use tooltip infrastructure.

== Dependencies / Related Features ==
Depends on PatternFly. Nothing depends on this.

== Testing ==
Testing involves
* Regression. Make sure screens haven't changed at all, in look or functionality. Pay special attention to grid columns, headers, and tooltips in both cells and headers.
* Make sure all tooltips look the same. There should be no blue or yellow tooltips anywhere.
