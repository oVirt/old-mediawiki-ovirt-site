== Gluster Volume Asynchronous Tasks  ==

=== Summary ===
This feature provide the support for managing the asynchronous tasks on Gluster volumes.
See: [[Features/Gluster_Volume_Asynchronous_Tasks_Management| Gluster Volume Asynchronous Tasks Management]]

=== Current status ===
* Target Release: TBD
* Status: Development in progress
* Last updated: {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}<!--This is markup for current date, do not change-->

== Design ==
=== Database changes  ===
* Change to stored procedure CheckIfJobHasTasks
** Add 'GLUSTER' as external system type to check if a job has tasks.
* Add a stored procedure GetStepsByExternalTaskId
** Returns the Step entities associated with an external task id
*** used to update status of step when external task status changes.

=== Class Diagram ===
[[File:GlusterAsyncTaskClassDiagram.png]]

* GlusterTasksSyncJob - a periodic background job that queries for list of tasks along with status
''uses''
* GlusterTaskService - to get the list of running tasks in cluster
''which returns''
* GlusterAsyncTask - encapsulates information about the Gluster task
* GlusterTaskType
** REBALANCE
** REMOVE_BRICK
* GlusterTaskStatus
** RUNNING
** FAILED
** COMPLETED
** ABORTED
** PAUSED

If GlusterTaskService returns a task that is not currently in the database, the information related to the task needs to be persisted in the engine database for further monitoring.
 -- TODO --
 Can we use External Tasks --> AddExternalJobCommand to create this?

All long running commands will inherit from
* GlusterAsyncCommandBase
** Creates a SUB-STEP on execution of command and associate the step with external task id
** Abstract method getStepType - inheriting classes to return the StepEnum to be added as Sub step when executing the command
** Abstract method executeAndReturnTask which inheriting classes should implement by calling the corresponding VDS command. The method should return a GlusterAsyncTask object that holds the id of the gluster task that was started due to the command.

The following sequence diagram explains the Gluster tasks monitoring mechanism

=== REST API ===

* Add startrebalance action on the gluster volumes resource

 /api/clusters/{id}/glustervolumes/{id}/startrebalance
This will return a step id which can be monitored from jobs/step api url

* Add stoprebalance action on the gluster volumes resource

 /api/clusters/{id}/glustervolumes/{id}/stoprebalance
This will stop the rebalance action that is currently in progress

* Modify the delete verb for bricks
 /api/clusters/{id}/glustervolumes/{id}/bricks/remove
Allow a collection of bricks to be removed. This will not migrate data first

* Add migrate action to the gluster bricks resource 
 /api/clusters/{id}/glustervolumes/{id}/bricks/startmigrate

Allow data on collection of bricks to be migrated. This will  return a step id which can be monitored from jobs/step api url

* Add stop migrate action to the gluster bricks resource 
 /api/clusters/{id}/glustervolumes/{id}/bricks/stopmigrate
This will stop the migration of data from the bricks that is currently in progress

TBD: How do we monitor the status of the rebalance and remove-brick operations? Can we use step ids or task ids?
