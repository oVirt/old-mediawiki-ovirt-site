== Cluster emulation mode ==

=== Summary ===
This feature will enable per cluster emulation mode. EmulatedMachine is a property passed to QEMU as -M flag and  Instead of a system-wide config value <br/>
A cluster could have a specific value which all host must comply to. If the cluster has no value set, the first host that is active <br/>
must comply to a configurable list of values and then set it thereafter.

=== Current status ===
* Draft Design
* Last updated: {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}<!--This is markup for current date, do not change-->
* Target Release: 3.3

=== Detailed Description ===
We want to keep the cluster homogeneous but be able to have different types cross-cluster i.e  one cluster to be RHELs and another to be Fedora based.<br/>
to achieve that we need a config value, per version with a list of supported emulation types, order by priority:

==== New Config value ====
 ClusterEmulationModes(3.0,"rhel6.2.0, pc-1.0")
 ClusterEmulationModes(3.1,"rhel6.3.0, pc-1.0")
 ClusterEmulationModes(3.2,"rhel6.4.0, pc-1.0")
 ClusterEmulationModes(3.3,"rhel6.4.0, pc-1.0")

==== New Host field ====
new "emulatedMachines" field will be added to vds_dynamic table. 
 vds_dynamic.emulated_machines
==== New Cluster field ====
A cluster entity will be added by a new field - emulatedMachine. <br/>
 vds_group.emulated_machine default NULL varchar(255)
The default is NULL which means the value would be set once a host during the first refresh would have<br/>
its reported emulatedMachines list match against the Config Value<br/>

==== New NON_OPERATIONAL reason ====
 NonOperationalReason
  ...,
  UNSUPPORTED_EMULATION_MODE;

==== HandleVdsCpuFlagsOrClusterChangedCommand ====

This commands will match an activated Host against the cluster definition. <br/>
If the cluster is null then the host will be matched against the config values. That match <br/>
will set the cluster definition for the rest of the hosts in that cluster <br/>

consider this pseudo-code:

 operational = false 
 if cluster.emulationMode == NULL
  for configVal in Config.ClusterEmulationMode(3.3)
     if configVal in host.emulationModes 
         cluster.emulationMode = configVal
         operational = true
  else if clusterEmulationMode in host.emulationMode
        operational = true
 if (!operational)
     set host non operationl, reason = UNSUPPORTED_EMULATION_MODE

==== New UI subtab field (readonly) ====
TODO A sketch of cluster subtab

=== Testing ===
* Test case: '''Vm start up - A cluster of fedora nodes and cluster of RHEL6 should be both supported out of the box'''
**setup:
Cluster "f" has 1 fedora host,  compat version 3.3<br/>
Cluster "R" has 1 RHEL6 host. compat version 3.3<br/>
DB config values for clusterEmulationMode = "el6,pc-1.0"  version 3.3<br/>
**test:
create a VM on each cluster and start it

**expected result:
A vm is able to start on each of the clusters.

* Test case: '''Host with unsupported emulation mode goes NON-OPERATIONAL  with reason UNSUPPORTED_EMULATION_MODE'''
**setup: use the same setup as the former case
**test: add a RHEL6 node to cluster "f"
**expected result: host should go NON_OPERATIONAL with reason UNSUPPORTED_EMULATION_MODE
