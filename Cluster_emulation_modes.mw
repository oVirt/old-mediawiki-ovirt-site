== Cluster emulation mode ==

=== Summary ===
This feature will enable per cluster emulation mode. EmulatedMachine is a property passed to QEMU as -M flag and  Instead of a system-wide config value <br/>
 a cluster could have a specific value which all host must comply to. If the cluster has no value set, the first host that is active <br/>
must comply to a configurable list of values and then set it thereafter.

=== Current status ===
* Draft Design

* Target Release: 3.3

=== Detailed Description ===
We want to keep the cluster homogeneous but be able to have different types cross-cluster i.e  one cluster to be RHELs and another to be Fedora based.<br/>
to achieve that we need a config value, per version with a list of supported emulation types, order by priority:
==== new Config value ====
ClusterEmulationModes(3.0,"rhel6.2.0, pc-1.0")
ClusterEmulationModes(3.1,"rhel6.3.0, pc-1.0")
ClusterEmulationModes(3.2,"rhel6.4.0, pc-1.0")
ClusterEmulationModes(3.3,"rhel6.4.0, pc-1.0")

==== New Host emulated
==== Cluster field ====
A cluster entity will be added by a new field - emulatedMachine. <br/>
The default is NULL which means the value would be set once a host during the first refresh would have<br/>
its reported emulatedMachines list match against the Config Value<br/>

consider this pseudo-code:
 if cluster.emulationMode == NULL
  for val in Config.ClusterEmulationMode(3.3)
     if HOST.
