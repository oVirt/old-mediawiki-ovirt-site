This standard operating procedure (SOP) describes how to create and configure a Mailman mailing list on lists.ovirt.org.

== Create the list ==

# Run <code>sudo /usr/lib/mailman/bin/newlist $listname</code> to create a new list.
#* Fill out details as requested by Mailman, noting the password.
# Add the sections Mailman outputs to ''/etc/aliases'' for each mailing list, then run <code>sudo newaliases</code>.
# Add the list administrator password to the file ''/root/passwords''.
# Email the list owner(s) with the list password.
#* Do this before or after configuring the list, making sure to inform them of the special configuration details.

== Configure the list ==

# Use the administrator password to log in to the admin web interface.
# Add additional administrators, if applicable.
# Configure the list as per the [[#Individual list-type configurations]] section.

=== Individual list-type configurations ===

==== Configuration for -commits list ====

* Set ''max_message_size'' to 0
* Set ''accept_these_nonmembers'' ???

==== Configuration for a -patches list ====

* Set ''max_message_size'' to 4000
* Set ''private_roster'' to ''List members''
* Set ''respond_to_post_requests'' to ''No''.

==== Configuration for -devel (discussion) list: ====

* Archives public
* Subscription confirmation-only
* Set ''respond_to_post_requests'' to ''No''.

==== Configuration for a -private list ====

* Archives set to private
* Subscription requires approval
* Must display in list-of-lists - it's private but not kept a secret
* For private discussion lists, posts require approval if not from a list member
** You may want to set ''respond_to_post_requests'' to ''No'' unless you specifically want posters to know they are held for moderation.

==== Configuration for a no-archives -private list ====

This is a rare configuration, usually reserved for security-related issues.

* Archives disabled and set to private
* Subscription requires approval
* Must display in list-of-lists - it's private but not kept a secret
* For private discussion lists, posts require approval if not from a list member

==== Configuration for an open-sender list ====

* Set ''accept_these_nonmembers'' to <code>^.*</code> - i.e., a regular expression meaning "every possible incoming email address."
* Set ''respond_to_post_requests'' to ''No''.
