=== Detailed Description ===
The suggest api implementation should maintain existing api for the sake of backward compatibility, hence until 4.0 all former apis will be maintained.
 
==== Entity Description ====
A new entity named NetworkAttachment will be added to the system. The NetworkAttachment will represent a network which is configured on a host.<br>
The NetworkAttachment can be attached to a network interface or not. If not attached to a network interface, the network is considered a nic-less network.
A new table '''network_attachments''' will be added :

<span style="color:Teal">'''NETWORK_ATTACHMENTS'''</span> Describes a network configured on a host:<BR>
{|class="wikitable sortable"
!border="1"| Column Name ||Column Type ||Null? / Default ||Definition 
|-
|id ||UUID ||not null ||The network attachment ID 
|-
|network_id ||UUID ||not null ||The configured network ID
|-
|external ||Boolean ||not null ||Indicates if the network is external
|-
|nic_id ||UUID ||null ||The network interface id on which the network is configured (nic or bond)
|-
|boot_protocol ||String ||null ||The network boot protocol
|-
|ip_address ||String ||null ||The desired network ip address
|-
|netmask ||String ||null ||The desired network netmask
|-
|gateway ||String ||null ||The desired network gateway
|-
|properties ||Text ||null ||The desired network properties
|-
|}

The entity will allow to differentiate between the desired network configuration to what is actually configured on the host.<br>
By that the engine will have a better capability to report more cases of network out-of-sync.<br>

=== Detailed Design ===
==== New commands ====
* '''AddNetworkAttachmentCommand''' - adds a network attachment to a host<br>
* '''UpdateNetworkAttachmentCommand''' - updates network attachment on a host<br>
* '''RemoveNetworkAttachmentCommand''' - removes a network attachment from the host<br>
* '''GetNetworkAttachmentByIdQuery''' - returns network attachment by its id<br>
* '''GetNetworkAttachmentsByNicIdQuery''' - returns all network attachments which are configured on top of a given nic<br>
* '''GetNetworkAttachmentsByHostIdQuery''' - returns all network attachments which are configured on top of a given host<br>
* '''SetupNetworksCommand''' - performs multiple network attachments changes on a host at once<br>
** The old '''SetupNetworksCommand''' will be renamed to '''SetupNicsCommand'''

==== Updated commands ====
* '''SetupNetworksCommand''' - In case of a failure, if 'checkConnnectivity' is set, compensation for network attachments should be triggered. If 'checkConnnectivity' is unset, no compensation is required for the network attachments.

* Host network capabilities update (CollectVdsNetworkData) should be updated to consider the network attachment entity management:
** Network attachment should be preserved if its nic was reported
** Network attachment should be removed if its nic was not reported
<br>
The '''SetupNetworksCommand''' will use the '''SetupNetworksVDSCommand''' (vdsm api) directly to provision networks on the host.<br>
The other commands which uses setup networks will continue to use '''SetupNicsCommand''':

  AddNetworkAttachmentCommand -------|
  UpdateNetworkAttachmentCommand ----|
                                     +------- SetupNetworksCommand ------ SetupNetworksVDSCommand
  RemoveNetworkAttachmentCommand ----|
  SetupNicsCommand ------------------|

==== VDS Command ====
The setupnetworks API exposed by VDSM remains the same:
  for each network:
    create attributes map:
      bonding : name | nic : name
      vlan : id
      [
       bootproto : dhcp 
       or
       ipaddr : ip
       netmask : netmask
       gateway : gateway
      ]
      mtu : int
      bridged : true / false
      STP : yes / no
      qosInbound : { average : int, peak: int, burst: int }
      qosOutbound : { average : int, peak: int, burst: int }
      defaultRoute : True
      custom: {}
      -- OR --
      remove : True
   add { network name : attributes } to map
    
  for each bond:
    create attributes map:
       nics=[nic1 , nic2, ...]
       options="<bonding-options>"
       -- OR --
       remove=True
 
 Addition attributes:
  connectivityCheck
  connectivityTimeout

'''HostSetupNetworksParameters''' will hold the relevant information to be sent to '''HostSetupNetworksVDSCommand'''.<br>
'''HostSetupNetworksParameters''' will be created by '''HostSetupNetworksCommand'''.
