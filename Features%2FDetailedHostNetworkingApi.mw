=== Detailed Description ===
The suggest api implementation should maintain existing api for the sake of backward compatibility, hence until 4.0 all former apis will be maintained.
 
==== Entity Description ====
A new entity named NetworkConnection will be added to the system. The NetworkConnection will represent a network which is configured on a host.<br>
The NetworkConnection can be attached to a network interface or not. If not attached to a network interface, the network is considered a nic-less network.
A new table '''network_connections''' will be added :

<span style="color:Teal">'''NETWORK_CONNECTIONS'''</span> Describes a network configured on a host:<BR>
{|class="wikitable sortable"
!border="1"| Column Name ||Column Type ||Null? / Default ||Definition 
|-
|id ||UUID ||not null ||The network connection ID 
|-
|network_id ||UUID ||not null ||The configured network ID
|-
|external ||Boolean ||not null ||Indicates if the network is external
|-
|nic_id ||UUID ||null ||The network interface id on which the network is configured (nic or bond)
|-
|boot_protocol ||String ||null ||The network boot protocol
|-
|ip_address ||String ||null ||The desired network ip address
|-
|netmask ||String ||null ||The desired network netmask
|-
|gateway ||String ||null ||The desired network gateway
|-
|properties ||Text ||null ||The desired network properties
|-
|}

The entity will allow to differentiate between the desired network configuration to what is actually configured on the host.<br>
By that the engine will have a better capability to report more cases of network out-of-sync.<br>

=== Detailed Design ===
==== New commands ====
* '''AddNetworkConnectionCommand''' - adds a network connection to a host<br>
* '''UpdateNetworkConnectionCommand''' - updates network connection on a host<br>
* '''RemoveNetworkConnectionCommand''' - removes a network connection from the host<br>
* '''GetNetworkConnectionByIdQuery''' - returns network connection by its id<br>
* '''GetNetworkConnectionsByNicIdQuery''' - returns all network connections which are configured on top of a given nic<br>
* '''GetNetworkConnectionsByHostIdQuery''' - returns all network connections which are configured on top of a given host<br>
* '''SetupNicsCommand''' - performs multiple network connections changes on a host at once<br>
** Network connection configured on a newly created bond:
*** The bond entity should be saved be persisted prior to sending the request, so its ID can be maintained for the network connection entity.

==== Updated commands ====
* '''SetupNetworksCommand''' - In case 'checkConnnectivity' is set, compensation for network connections should be triggered in case of a failure. If 'checkConnnectivity' is unset, no compensation is required for network connections.

* Host network capabilities update (CollectVdsNetworkData) should be updated to consider the network connection entity management:
** Network connection should be preserved if its nic was reported
** Network connection should be removed if its nic was not reported
