=== What is a wiki? ===
A wiki is a website where any visitor with sufficient permissions can change the web pages, by editing them in place using a very simple syntax. To protect this website against "spam" edits, users are required to create an account and authenticate their email address before making edits to pages. In addition, a small number of pages - [[Home | the front page]], [[Download]], [[Documentation]], [[Community]] and [[Develop]] are protected - which means that only site admins may edit them.
