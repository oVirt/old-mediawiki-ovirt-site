=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
oVirt Manager has the capability to flag individual VMs for High Availability, meaning that in the event of a host failure, these VMs will be rebooted on an alternate hypervisor host.  Today, it is possible that the resultant utilization of a cluster during a host failure may either not allow or could cause a notable performance degradation when HA VMs are rebooted.  HA VM Reservations will serve as a mechanism to ensure appropriate capacity exists within a cluster for HA VMs in the event the host they currently resides on fails unexpectedly.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Provide assurance to the end user that critical VMs will have access to the required resources in the event of a host failure without negatively impacting the collective performance of existing workloads
