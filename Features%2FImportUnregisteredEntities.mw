{{Feature|name=Detach/Attach Storage Domains with entities|entities=engine/vdsm|status=Released|version=3.5}}

== Summary ==
Today the operation of moving entities, such as VMs or Templates, from one Data Center to another Data Center in the same setup must be done through a mediator called Export Storage Domain.<BR/>
This migration of those entities is being done by two copy operations, one is done to the mediator (Export Storage Domain) and another copy is from the Export Storage Domain to the target Storage Domain.<BR/>
Needless to say those operations requires allocation of free space in the Export Storage domain, and takes a long time to be accomplished.<BR/>
<BR/>
There is a requirement to add the ability of migrating entities from one Data Center to another without the use of a mediator, and by that, save the heavy operation of the copy operation.<BR/>
Today we can detach a Storage Domain from the DC, only if it is empty, i.e. does not contain any disks or VMs/Templates<BR/>
The new feature should add the ability for the  user to detach a Storage Domain containing VMs/Templates and Disks, and re-attach it again to another Data Center.<BR/>
<BR/>
Each Data Storage Domain is an entity which contains disks and sometime VM's and Template's OVF.<BR/>
The OVF is an XML standard representing the VM/Template configuration, including disks, memory, CPU and more.<BR/>
Based on this information stored in the Storage Domain, we can relate the disks, VMs and Templates to any Data Center which we will relate the Storage Domain to.<BR/>

== Owner ==

* Email <mlipchuk@redhat.com>

== Current status ==
* Implemented

== General Functionality ==
* On detach of Storage Domain the VMs/Templates related to the Storage Domain should be deleted from the engine, but their data will be converted to an XML data which will be preserved in a DB table called unregistered_ovf_of_entities, and will still be part of the OVF disk contained in the Storage Domain.<BR/>
* On attach the user will be able to choose the VMs/Templates/Disks he/she desires to register in the Data Center, and will choose which Cluster each Vm/Template will be assigned with.
* Shareable and Direct lun disks are not supported in the OVF file today (See [1])<BR/>
* The VMs and Templates which are candidates to be registered, must exists in the Storage Domain OVF contained in the unregistered_ovf_of_entities table. (see [2])
* All the Storage Domains of the VMs/Templates disks must be active in the target Data Center when the user register the entity.(see [3])

== Implementation gaps ==
[1]  hence if a VM includes a shareable or direct lun disks, a warning will be prompted to the user, indicating the following 
  Attention, The following VMs contains shareable/direct lun disks which will not be part of the VM configuration after the detach will take place: {vmNames}.
[2]: There is a gap that VMs/Templates with no disks do not exist in the Storage Domain's OVF, therefore those VMs will not be present in the setup on attach operation.<BR/>



==== REST ====
===== Get list of unregistered VM/Template =====
The use can get a list of all the unregistered VMs or unregistered Templates by adding the prefix ";unregistered" after the vms/Templates, in the Storage Domain.<BR>
For example to get all the unregistered VMs in the Storage Domain 68ca2f73-9b15-4839-83c9-859244ad2cd3 the URL will be :
http://localhost:8080/api/storagedomains/68ca2f73-9b15-4839-83c9-859244ad2cd3/vms;unregistered
[[File:UnregisterVM2.png]]
===== Register VM to a new cluster =====
If the user want to register a VM to the setup, then the URL should indicate register after the VM id, as follow:
http://localhost:8080/api/storagedomains/xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx/vms/xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx/register

==== UI ====
===== Import VM/Template sub-tabs =====

===== Import VM/Template Dialog =====
