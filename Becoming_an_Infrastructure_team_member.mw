This page describes the process for becoming a member of the Infrastructure team (a [[Becoming a maintainer|maintainer]].)

=== Step 1: Get involved ===

The Infrastructure team primarily uses three resources to get stuff done:
* [http://lists.ovirt.org/mailman/listinfo/infra The infra mailing list] for asynchronous communication
* [https://fedorahosted.org/ovirt/report/1 oVirt infra trac] for issue tracking
* [[Infrastructure team meetings | The weekly infra team meeting]] on IRC for synchronous discussion and review of action items

In general, the team hangs out on the general #oVirt IRC channel on OFTC.

A great first step to getting involved in the Infrastructure team is to introduce yourself on the mailing list, and to start attending the team meetings, if it's possible for you.

In step 1, you should [[Category:Infrastructure | get familiar with the team work presses]] and [[Infrastructure team administrators | its members]], the skills we have, the infrastructure we use (like [[/Infrastructure git repository | git]] and [[Infrastructure Puppet details | puppet]]) and [[Infrastructure team task list | the things we have on our agenda to accomplish]]. Perhaps you have the time and skills to make suggestions as to how something might be accomplished, or research possible solutions to a problem and make a proposal, to allow other team members to put a solution in place quickly? Perhaps you've noticed something which can be improved, and you would like to add an issue to our Trac instance to help ensure it gets done.

=== Step 2: Propose changes - build trust ===

After a few weeks attending our meetings and/or participating in the mailing list, you will begin to build trust in the team. Patch proposals, and showing good judgement in the changes you propose, will accelerate the trust process.

Because we use virtualized infrastructure, the natural next step is to [[Adding a new system administrator to a host | become an administrators of a virtual machine]]  to install a new service for the project. As an apprentice administrator, the service will be in incubation for a period of time, during which your administration and promotion of the service will be observed.

After an incubation period, whose length will depend on the quality and quantity of your contributions, and your cultural fit with the team, you will become [[Category:Infrastructure#Team | a core team member]]. Congratulations!
