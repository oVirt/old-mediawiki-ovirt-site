= SPICE Proxy =

== Summary ==
Let the users define a proxy which will be used by SPICE client to connect to the guest.

== Detailed Description ==
Currently, the only possibility to define a SPICE proxy is using the engine-config tool globally for the whole application. Example:
 <nowiki>
engine-config -s SpiceProxy=someProxy
 </nowiki>
The proxy has to follow the following form:
<nowiki>
[protocol://]<host>[:port]
</nowiki>

The proxy string may be specified with a protocol:// prefix to specify alternative proxy protocols. If no protocol is specified in the proxy string or if the string doesn't match a supported one, the proxy will be treated as a HTTP proxy.

To turn the proxy off, just clear it:
 <nowiki>
engine-config -s SpiceProxy=""
 </nowiki>

If the proxy is set, it will be filled into the Proxy property of the SPICE client by WebAdmin/UserPortal. If the proxy is not set, nothing is filled into this property.
