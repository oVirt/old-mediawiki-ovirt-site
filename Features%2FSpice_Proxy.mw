= SPICE Proxy =

== Summary ==
Let the users define a proxy which will be used by SPICE client to connect to the guest. It is useful when the user (e.g. using user portal) is outside of the network where the hypervisors are.

== Detailed Description ==
There are three places where to set the SPICE proxy up:
*  Global Configuration
*  Cluster (overrides the global configuration)
*  VM Pool (overrides global configuration and cluster configuration)

=== Global Configuration ===
The engine-config tool is used to globally configure the SPICE proxy for the whole application. Example:
 <nowiki>
engine-config -s SpiceProxyDefault=someProxy
 </nowiki>
The proxy has to follow the following form:
<nowiki>
[protocol://]<host>[:port]
</nowiki>

The proxy string may be specified with a protocol:// prefix to specify alternative proxy protocols. If no protocol is specified in the proxy string or if the string doesn't match a supported one, the proxy will be treated as a HTTP proxy.

To turn the proxy off, just clear it:
 <nowiki>
engine-config -s SpiceProxyDefault=""
 </nowiki>

If the proxy is set, it will be by default filled into the Proxy property of the SPICE client by WebAdmin/UserPortal. If the proxy is not set, nothing is filled into this property.

=== Frontend ===
In User Portal/Web Admin SPICE proxy can be disabled / enabled per VM using the console options popup dialog and this setting will be stored in the local storage (or cookie). The specific behavior: 
*  If the SPICE proxy is globally configured using the engine-config tool (described above), than:
** an enabled checkbox with label "Enable SPICE Proxy" will be present
** it is by default checked
** if checked, the SPICE proxy will be used
** if unchecked checked, the global SPICE proxy configuration will be ignored and the VM will connect directly to the guest
* If SPICE proxy is not set globally, than:
** a disabled and unchecked checkbox will be present with label "Enable SPICE Proxy"
** it will have a title: "no SPICE proxy defined on system level"
** the SPICE will connect directly to the guest
