===Summary ===
Network Quality of Service feature will be added to oVirt from version 3.3 and will support cluster version 3.3 or higher.<br />
The feature will allow the user to limit the inbound and outbound network traffic in virtual NIC level.<br />
In order to define more natural coupling of the QoS to a VNIC we define a new concept called '''VNIC Profile'''. The VNIC profile will be applied in oVirt 3.3 to all clusters and will wrap few of the properties currently defined directly on the VNIC.<br />

see [[http://www.ovirt.org/Features/Network_QoS Network QoS]] for detailed description of the feature

* Last updated: {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}<!--This is markup for current date, do not change-->
* patchset

= Design and Implementation =
The Network QoS feature includes two main parts:
* VNIC level QoS
* VNIC Profiles
The two parts will be developed in parallel 
  
== QoS ==
=== GUI ===
see : [[Features/Network_QoS|QoS Feature overview]]

=== Backend ===
We define a new entity called "NetworkQoS" - the QoS properties will be contained in this object.
A NetworkQoS object will be added to NetworkInterface entity
A new entity will be created (NetworkQoS) which will hold the QoS properties.
NetworkQoS field will be added to NetworkInterface object and Network object. Fields values will be seved in DB and ovf.

==== Classes ====
'''''engine.core.common.businessentities.network.NetworkQoS'''' - new entity with fields: inboundAverage(Integer),  inboundPeak(Integer), inboundBurst(Long), outboundAverage(Integer),  outboundPeak(Integer), outboundBurst(Long)<BR/>
'''''engine.core.common.businessentities.network.NetworkInterface'''''  - add fields: networkQoS(NetworkQoS)<BR/>
'''''engine.core.common.businessentities.network.Network''''' - add fields: networkQoS(NetworkQoS)<BR/>
'''''engine.core.vdsbroker.vdsbroker.VmInfoBuilder''''' - add support to the QoS properties<BR/>
'''''engine.core.utils.ovf.OvfWriter''''  - add support to the QoS properties<BR/>
'''''engine.core.utils.ovf.OvfReader''''  - add support to the QoS properties<BR/>
'''''engine.core.dao.network.VmNetworkQoSDao'''''  - new Dao<BR/>
'''''engine.core.dao.network.VmNetworkInterfaceDao'''''  - add support to the NetworkQoS field<BR/>
'''''engine.core.dao.network.VmNetworkDao'''''  - add support to the NetworkQoS field<BR/>

=== DB Change ===
Add NetworkQoS table with  7 columns.

{|class="wikitable sortable"
!border="1"| Column Name ||Column Type ||Null? / Default 
|-
|id ||UUID || 
|-
|inbound_average ||Integer || 
|-
|inbound_peak ||Integer || 
|-
|inbound_burst||Integer || 
|-
|outbound_average ||Integer || 
|-
|outbound_peak ||Integer || 
|-
|outbound_burst ||Integer || 
|-
|}

Add network_QoS_id(UUID | null)  to the '''vm_interface''' table - Represents the properties of the virtual NIC.<br />
Add network_QoS_id(UUID | null) and network_QoS_default_for_vnic_id(UUID | null) to the '''network'''  table.<br />

=== REST API ===
Not supported in this version

=== VDSM ===
libvirt version 1.0.1 or higher is required to enable the QoS feature (vdsm 3.3 will use higher version). 
* Add support of QoS properties in VDSM API: run VM, hot plug and update VM device verbs (update in schema) 
* Add support in the vnic object and the vnic to_xml()
