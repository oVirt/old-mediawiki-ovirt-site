===Summary ===
Network Quality of Service feature will be added to oVirt from version 3.3 and will support cluster version 3.3 or higher.<br />
The feature will allow the user to limit the inbound and outbound network traffic in virtual NIC level.<br />
In order to define more natural coupling of the QoS to a VNIC we define a new concept called '''Network Profile'''. The Network profile will be applied in oVirt 3.3 to all clusters and will wrap few of the properties currently defined directly on the VNIC

=== Detailed Description  ===
==== QoS ====
Traffic shaping is a very common practice in network management. Traffic shaping allows the network administrator to prevent over consumption of network resources by limiting the bandwidth in several layers. Current implementation of libvirt allows limiting the bandwidth in the virtual NIC level for both inbound and outbound traffic. The Network QoS on oVirt make use of that API and allows the network administrator to define network limitations on specific VNICs.      

The QoS properties are properties which defines the traffic shaping applied on the virtual NIC . QoS properties currently include:
* Inbound
** Average - long-term limit around which  traffic should float (Mbps)
** Peak - the maximum allowed bandwidth during burst (Mbps) 
** Burst - The burst size (Mb)
*Outbound
** Average - long-term limit around which  traffic should float (Mbps)
** Peak - the maximum allowed bandwidth during burst (Mbps) 
** Burst - The burst size (Mb)
For example:  if average is set to 100 units, peak to 200 and burst to 50, after sending those 50 units of data at rate 200, the rate will fall down to 100.

Traffic shaping using the Network QoS feature will be available only for oVirt networks at this stage. Externally provided networks (such as Quantum) may be supported in future extensions.

==== Network Profile ====
The Network Profile concept embodies a predefined package of network setting  which will define the network service a VNIC will get.<br />
Network Profile include:<br />
* Profile name
* Network
* Quality of Service
* Port mirroring
* Custom properties

When creating a new VNIC or editing an existing one the user will select a Network Profile (instead of the current implementation in which the user selects a network and sets port mirroring and custom properties).<br />
The network administrator could create several Network Profiles for each network. He could then granted users with the permission to use (consume) each profile. The user will only be able to use profiles which he was granted access to. 

:For example: the network admin will create two Network profiles for network "blue": Profile "Gold" - with better QoS and no port mirroring and profile "Silver" with lower QoS and enabled port mirroring. He will then define the user-group "students" as user of profile "Silver" and user-group "teachers" as user of profile "Gold". In this case the teachers will enjoy better quality of service then the students. When a teacher will add/edit a virtual NIC he could select profile "Gold" for that NIC - the VNIC will be connected to network "blue" with high QoS and no port mirroring. 

The Network Profile could be edited by the network administrator at any time. The changes will seep down to all VNICs using the profile. In case VNIC using the edited profile are connected to running VMs the chnage will not take effect automatically. Instead, the user will be presented with a "non synchronized" icon on the specific VNIC and could manually synchronize it. Manual synchronization will only be possible in cases which can be handled while the VNIC is connected (such as rewire network or redefine QoS values). If changes in the profile require unplugging the VNIC the manual synchronization will be blocked and the user will be advised to unplug the vnic and try again.

When a Template is created from a VM the Network Profile will be kept along with the VNIC. When a VM is created from template the Network Profiles will be taken from the template's VNICs.

Network Profiles could not be deleted from the engine as long as one or more VM/Templates are using those profiles.

The Network Profiles will be exported and imported together with the VNIC. If the user will import a VM which is using a profile not exist in the system, he will be notified and the VNIC will be connected to a default minimal profile defined in the system.

=== Benefit to oVirt  ===
We would like to expose to the user the ability to configure the Network Quality of Service (QoS) properties of each virtual NIC. The Network QoS feature will add this ability to the engine. The Network profile will improve the usability of the network configuration on the VM. On the user side - Network profiles will allow the user to configure a VNIC in relative ease. On the network administrator side - Network Profiles will allow the administrator keep control of all the VNICs connected to the network in a simpler way.<br />
The combination of the two will allow the network admin to define, control and dispense different service qualities (different priorities) to different users or groups.

= Design and Implementation =
The Network QoS feature includes two main parts:
* VNIC level QoS
* Network level (host level) QoS
The two parts will be developed in two independent phases
  
== VNIC level QoS ==
Target release: 3.3 (p1)

QoS properties for VNIC will be attached to VNIC, but  since not all users which can attach VNICs could edit those properties, we also define default QoS properties for VNIC which can be defined per each network. A user with a NetworkAdmin role would be able to define those default values for VNIC on each network. The default values will be inherited by each VNIC attached to the network, unless they have been overridden in the VNIC itself. only a user holding a NetworkAdmin role could override the default properties.

If QoS properties were overridden in the VNIC itself the set properties will be kept if the VM holding that VNIC when saved to Template, exported and imported. If the QoS properties were not overridden in the VNIC, they will remain at synch with the default values for VNIC set on the network. 

=== GUI (VNIC level) ===
The UI for setting of  QoS properties will be added to the Add/Edit VNIC dialog.<br />
The newly added part will be visible only to user with the permission to edit QoS properties, both in Administrator and User portal.

'''UI addition to the Add/Edit VNIC dialog'''<br />
[[File:QoS.png]]

In the Add/Edit Network two parts will be added: <br />
- QoS properties of the network(discussed in the next phase) <br />
- QoS properties default for VNICs attached to the network (discussed here).<br />

'''UI addition to the Add/Edit Network dialog'''<br />
[[File:Network_quality_of_service_2.png]]

The user could enable/disable the QoS properties (for each inbound / outbound).  Disabled QoS will mean no limitation on the traffic in this direction<br />
The panel holding the properties will be collapsed by default (extendable panel).<br />
Once inbound/outbound was enabled all three field must be filled (This will be verified before allowing to close the dialog).<br />
If QoS properties were set in the network dialog as default for all VNICs attached to that network - these setting will appear in the VNIC. The user can override them in the VNIC dialog. If the default values were overridden a "Revert to network default" hyperlink will appear, allowing the user to easily revert to network defaults.  

User with no permission to edit the QoS properties will see no change in the UI.

=== Backend ===
We define a new entity called "NetworkQoS" - the QoS properties will be contained in this object.
A NetworkQoS object will be added to NetworkInterface entity
A new entity will be created (NetworkQoS) which will hold the QoS properties.
NetworkQoS field will be added to NetworkInterface object and Network object. Fields values will be seved in DB and ovf.

Add network_QoS_id(UUID | null) and network_QoS_default_for_vnic_id(UUID | null) to the '''network'''  table.<br />

=== REST API ===
Not supported in this version

=== VDSM ===
libvirt version 1.0.1 or higher is required to enable the QoS feature (vdsm 3.3 will use higher version). 
* Add support of QoS properties in VDSM API: run VM, hot plug and update VM device verbs (update in schema) 
* Add support in the vnic object and the vnic to_xml()
