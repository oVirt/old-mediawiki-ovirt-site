== CPU-Host Support ==

=== Summary ===
CPU-Host support allows the virtual machines to see and utilize the host's CPU flags, this enables better performance in VM's, at the price of worse portablity.

=== Current status ===
* Planning
* Last updated date: 5 Dec 2012

=== Detailed Description ===

Since with host-passthrough gives the host cpu-capabilities to the VM's CPU, migration can not happen to different CPU-models. This could still be acceptable if all the hosts are all uniform in the cluster.

* engine modifications:
** modify VmStatic, add useHostCpuFlags boolean property
*** database schema modification in tables, views and stored procedures
*** DAO modifications
** modify the Add/Edit VM dialog, add 'use host cpu flags' checkbox - it should be enabled only when Vm is pinned to host

* vdsm modifications:
** '''either''' add support to domain creation for host-passthrough - api parameter name could be 'useHostCpuFlags' http://gerrit.ovirt.org/9367
** '''OR''' add hostPassthrough and hostModel as special cpu types http://gerrit.ovirt.org/9507
** vdsm guys please decide
* rest-api:
** Add new attribute 'host_passthrough' to CPU

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Allows the users to get better performance from their VM's through using all CPU capabilities - including the ones not handled by qemu/kvm
