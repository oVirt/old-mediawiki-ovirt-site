{{Feature|name=Select Network for Gluster traffic|modules=engine,gluster|version=3.6|status=Design}}

== Summary ==
Currently, gluster nodes use the same network for both management traffic and gluster traffic when these nodes are managed by oVirt. The nodes use the IP address/ host name used when adding the host to oVirt for this. This causes issues as high glusterfs traffic chortles the management requests and VMs on these hosts sometimes fail to respond.

Gluster does not yet have a mechanism to specify which networks are to be used depending on the type of traffic - internal vs. others. There's a planned feature with some details here - [http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Features/SplitNetwork Gluster Split Network]

With existing feature set in Gluster, the proposed solution is to separate out the glusterfs traffic at the time of adding bricks to a gluster volume. Glusterfs uses the IP address specified for the brick for all traffic related to brick on that node. So, when a host has multiple interfaces, user can choose the interface to be used while adding the brick.

'''Limitations'''
* '''Network separation using brick IP addresses work only when the address used for adding brick is on external network as well''' (Clients need to see this IP address)
* Users with existing gluster deployments cannot use this feature, as once bricks are added there's no way to change the IP address used. There's no upgrade/migration path for feature
* If an IP address is used to add the brick, this interface cannot be changed unless brick is removed/replaced.

 Use replace-brick to achieve both of above (To be checked)

== Proposed User Flow ==

=== Select network in Add brick ===
1.  Add a Network role "Storage network"  and create a network with this role at '''Cluster''' level

2.  Edit a host, and assign the above network role to one of the host's interface.

3.  In Create Volume/ Add Brick dialog, once the host is selected to add a brick, the IP address from the interface in above step is used to add brick. 
* If the host has no interface with network role "Storage network", the host's address is used.

* Ensure that network with storage network role cannot be removed from cluster if it is used

=== Change network used by brick ===
# Provide an edit brick - where user can pick an IP address. This will call the "replace-brick commit force". '''Disruption in service may occur as the brick process will be restarted'''

== Implementation Details ==

=== Change to Network roles ===
Addition of a new Network role - Storage network

=== Change to GlusterBricks entity ===
GlusterBricks entity will have an additional property that holds the address used to add the brick. 
GlusterBrick.getQualifiedName() - changes to use the IP address rather than vds.host_name

=== Change to GlusterSyncJob ===
Update the correct IP address returned from gluster CLI output rather than mapping based on host UUID
