If you're installing oVirt 3.4.2 on a clean host you should read our [[Quick Start Guide]]


If you're upgrading from a previous version you should have ovirt-release package already installed on your system.
You can then install ovirt-release34.rpm as in a clean install side-by-side.
If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.4.0 you can now remove ovirt-release package:
 # yum remove ovirt-release
and then  just execute:
 # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
 # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from 3.3.2 or later, keep ovirt-release rpm in place until the upgrade is completed.
See [[oVirt 3.4.0 release notes]] for upgrading from previous versions.
