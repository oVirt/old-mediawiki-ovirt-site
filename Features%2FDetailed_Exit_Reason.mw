== Detailed Exit Reason ==

=== Summary ===

* Add a detailed exit code on VDSM ExitedVmStats to represent the reason why a VM was shut down, either normally or because of an error.
* Update engine to fetch and use this new value internally.
* The benefit for the engine is better reporting and better view of the status of the VM.
