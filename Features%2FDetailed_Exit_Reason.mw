== Detailed Exit Reason ==

WARNING: work in progress

=== Summary ===

* Add a detailed exit code on VDSM ExitedVmStats to represent the reason why a VM was shut down, either normally or because of an error.
* The new field will be called exitReason and will be an enumeration with errno-like semantics.
* Update engine to fetch and use this new value internally.
* The benefit for the engine is better reporting and better view of the status of the VM.

=== Current status ===
* Target Release: oVirt 3.5
* Status: Implementation vor VDSM and Engine in progress, patches posted on gerrit. See below for links.
* Last updated: 14 Feb 2014

=== Detailed Description ===
This change is transparent to the user because will only affect the VDSM <=> engine communication. User will notice only indirectly through more precise reporting and better behaviour in general.

Backward and forward compatibility must be ensured:
* updated engines must to deal properly with not-updated VDSMs and
* updated VDSMs must deal properly with not-updated engines.

since the communication between VDSM and engine happens through XML-RPC, not-updated engines will just discard the extra field.
In the case of an updated engine dealing with an old, not updated, VDSM, the missing field will be filled with a placeholder value with 'Value Unknown' semantics.
In this case the engine must not rely internally on the value of the new field and must behave as before.

==== Design Discussion ====

* Why an extra field?

ExitReason is (intentionally) a superset of ExitCode. When the values do overlap, they carry the same meaning.
The main driving factor to add a new field is to maximize the backward compatibility between VDSM and engine.
However, ExitReason do not convey only error semantic, but also specify why a VM ha succesfully terminated (e.g. migration succeeded).
