== Device Custom Properties ==

=== Summary ===

=== Detailed Description ===

Just like we can define VM-wide custom properties, we would like to set per-device ones. This would allow users to pass special parameters to connect a specific vNIC to a funky host network.


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
oVirt currently supports only one type of network connectivity: a vNIC is connected by a Linux bridge to a pre-existing host NIC, that is connected to the outer world. Users want to allow funkier types of connection, for example:
* Create a host nic (via Mellanox UFM) just in time, and connect it directly to the vNIC.
* Request OpenStack's Quantum to connect a vNIC to one of its defined networks.
* Pass non-standard QoS setting for a vNIC.

Similarly, users may want to connect a virtual disk to an "exotic" storage server, that requires special actions just before the VM is started.

These extensions, and many others, can be made available by allowing per-device custom properties. Device custom properties are just like VM-wide ones, only that they are attached to a specific device, and can take effect when the device is hot-plugged.
