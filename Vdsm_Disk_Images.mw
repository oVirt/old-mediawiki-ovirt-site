Vdsm exposes image repositories, each named "Storage Domain", which may be implemented by a local files system, an NFS export, or an LVM Virtual Group. Image comprises of 1 or more volumes.

=Volume Types=
Volumes have 2 major properties:
# '''type''' - How are the bits written to the underlying volume.
#* ''raw'' - means a simple raw access a write to offset X will be written on offset X
#* ''qcow2'' - means that the storage will be accessed as a qcow2 image and all that this entails
# '''allocation''' - How should VDSM allocated the storage
#* ''preallocated'' - VDSM will try it's best to guaranty that the all the storage that was requested. Some storage configuration may render preallocation pointless.
#* ''sparse'' - space will be allocated for the volume as needed


{| border="1"
|  |     || Preallocated || Sparse
|-
|  | Raw || *file/block  || file
|-
|  |qcow2|| *file/block  || file/block
|}

 *  Preallocating on file domains will cause Vdsm to write zeroes to the file.
    This might not actually preallocate on some file system.


=Snapshots=
Raw and qcow2 volumes can be the basis of a snapshot but only qcow2 volumes can be snapshots themselves.
