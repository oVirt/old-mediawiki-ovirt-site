=== Summary ===
This feature will add the possibility of hot plugging virtual memory modules into a running VM from the GWT frontend and the REST API.

* Email: vdelima@redhat.com

=== Current status ===
In planning.

=== Detailed Description ===
Dynamically resizing the amount of memory dedicated to a guest is an important feature, it allows server upgrades without restarting the VM.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Allows the admin of an oVirt based datacenter to dynamically resize the amount of RAM of each guest.

=== Detailed Design === 
The amount of memory destined to a VM will be available as an editable field in the "Edit VM" dialog while the VM is running, clicking OK will trigger a "Hot Set" action in the backend to adjust the VM memory without the need to tell from which physical NUMA cell it comes from or to which cell it goes.
