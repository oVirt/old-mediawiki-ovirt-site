Follow this process when responding to RSVP emails for oVirt events. This keeps us able to coordinate across timezones, while giving a polite and appropriate response to each RSVP and maintaining our records for sanity.

# When you receive an email to rsvp@ovirt.org, open the unique event shared spreadsheet (e.g. on Google Docs) and enter the details for the person or persons.
#* Ideally you want to receive an email from each person attending. This way you have a copy of the attendee list in the rsvp@ archives.
#* Do this first to you minimize the chance of mistakes in the attendee list.
# Reply to the email, choosing ''Reply-to-all''. You want to include the list rsvp@ovirt.org (for archiving) and any person the sender included in their Cc: - it might be a co-worker, manager, etc. and you want that person to know the RSVP status - on or not on the attendee list.
# In the email response include these essential pieces of information:
#* "Yes, you are now on the list of attendees."
#* "You will be added to the workshop announcement/coordination email list."
#* Consider the language barriers when writing responses
# After sending out one or all of the responses you have, add the attendees to the workshop specific mailing list.
#* Be sure to use the custom welcome text written for the event.
