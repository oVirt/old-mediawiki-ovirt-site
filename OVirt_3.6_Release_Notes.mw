{{DISPLAYTITLE:oVirt 3.6 Release Notes}}

DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT

<!--The oVirt development team is pleased to announce oVirt 3.6.0 Alpha release availability as of May 6th 2015.-->
oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an excellent KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.

= oVirt 3.6.0 ALPHA Release Notes =

== ALPHA RELEASE ==
The oVirt Project is working on oVirt 3.6.0 Alpha release

== Docker Integration ==
oVirt Engine setup now provides [[CinderGlance Docker Integration| Cinder and Glance]] automated deployment using Docker

==Self Hosted Engine FC Support==
Hosted Engine has now added support for [[Features/Self_Hosted_Engine_FC_Support|FC storage]]

==Self Hosted Engine Gluster Support==
* Hosted Engine has now added support for [[Features/Self_Hosted_Engine_Gluster_Support|Gluster storage]]
* Hosted Engine has now added support for [[Features/Self_Hosted_Engine_Hyper_Converged_Gluster_Support|Hyper Converged Gluster storage]]

== oVirt Live ==
oVirt Live has been rebased on CentOS 7 allowing to run oVirt in 3.6 compatibility mode

== Known Issues ==

* The engine fails with openjdk 1.8. Until this is fixed, workaround is to install java-1.7.0-openjdk, and make it default with update-alternatives, or just remove java-1.8.0-openjdk.
* This means that the engine is not supported on Fedora >= 21 (which does not have java-1.7.0-openjdk).

= Install / Upgrade from previous versions=

== ALPHA RELEASE ==
The oVirt Project is working on oVirt 3.6.0 Alpha release.
