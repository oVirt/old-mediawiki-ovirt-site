{{DISPLAYTITLE:oVirt 3.6 Alpha Release Notes}}
= oVirt 3.6.0 ALPHA Release Notes =
The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of  oVirt 3.6.0 first Alpha release as of May 20th, 2015. 

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization. 
This release is available now for Fedora 20, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6, CentOS 6.6, (or similar) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1, CentOS 7.1 (or similar).

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the [http://www.ovirt.org/Category:Releases previous versions release notes].
For a general overview of oVirt, read [[Quick_Start_Guide | the Quick Start Guide]] and the [[about oVirt]] page.

== OpenJDK support==
oVirt engine 3.6 requires <span style="color: red;">OpenJDK 1.7</span>, it will not work different version. Please take a look at [[#Install_.2F_Upgrade_from_previous_versions | Install / Upgrade from previous version]] section how to install properly.

== Docker Integration ==
oVirt Engine setup now provides [[CinderGlance Docker Integration| Cinder and Glance]] automated deployment using Docker

==Self Hosted Engine FC Support==
Hosted Engine has now added support for [[Features/Self_Hosted_Engine_FC_Support|FC storage]]

==Self Hosted Engine Gluster Support==
* Hosted Engine has now added support for [[Features/Self_Hosted_Engine_Gluster_Support|Gluster storage]]
* Hosted Engine has now added support for [[Features/Self_Hosted_Engine_Hyper_Converged_Gluster_Support|Hyper Converged Gluster storage]]

== oVirt Live ==
oVirt Live has been rebased on CentOS 7 allowing to run oVirt in 3.6 compatibility mode

== Known Issues ==

* Due to an issue with VDSM, ISO domains cannot be connected

* The engine fails with openjdk 1.8. Until this is fixed, workaround is to install java-1.7.0-openjdk, and make it default with update-alternatives, or just remove java-1.8.0-openjdk.
* This means that the engine is not supported on Fedora >= 21 (which does not have java-1.7.0-openjdk).

* Use SELinux Permissive mode in order to avoid denials using VDSM and Gluster

* NFS startup on EL7 / Fedora20: due to other bugs ({{BZ|1144440}}  or {{BZ|1066959}} ), NFS service is not always able to start at first attempt (it doesn't wait the kernel module to be ready); if it happens oVirt engine setup detects it and aborts with
 [ INFO  ] Restarting nfs services
 [ ERROR ] Failed to execute stage 'Closing up': Command '/bin/systemctl' failed to execute
Retrying (engine-cleanup, engine-setup again) it's enough to avoid it cause the kernel module it's always ready on further attempts. Manually starting NFS service (/bin/systemctl restart nfs-server.service) before running engine setup it's enough to avoid it at all.

* NFS startup on EL7.1 requires manual startup of rpcbind.service {{BZ|1171603}} before running engine setup in order to avoid
 [ INFO  ] Restarting nfs services
 [ ERROR ] Failed to execute stage 'Closing up': Command '/bin/systemctl' failed to execute

* Upgrade of All-in-One on EL6 and FC20 are not going to be supported in 3.6. VDSM and the packages requiring it are not built anymore for EL6 and FC20.

= Install / Upgrade from previous versions=

== ALPHA RELEASE ==
oVirt 3.6.0 Alpha release is available since 2015-06-29. In order to install it you've to enable oVirt 3.6 pre release repository.

In order to install it on a clean system, you need to run (see also [[#Known_Issues|Known Issues]] above):
 # yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk
 # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm

If you are upgrading from a previous version, you may have the ovirt-release35 package already installed on your system.
You can then install ovirt-release36.rpm as in a clean install side-by-side.

Once ovirt-release36 package is installed,  you will have the ovirt-3.6-pre repository and any other repository needed for satisfying dependencies enabled by default.

If you're installing oVirt 3.6.0 Alpha on a clean host, you should read our [[Quick Start Guide]].

If you are upgrading from oVirt  < 3.5.0, you must first upgrade to oVirt 3.5.0 or later.
Please see [[oVirt 3.5.2 release notes]] for upgrade instructions.

For upgrading now you just need to execute:
 # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
 # engine-setup

== oVirt Hosted Engine ==

If you're going to install oVirt as Hosted Engine on a clean system please follow [[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install]] guide.

If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow [[Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine]] guide.

== oVirt Live ==

A new oVirt Live ISO is available:
