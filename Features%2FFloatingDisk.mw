* Last updated date: Sun January 25 2011

== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Provide the details of the feature. What is it going to include. See the sections below. -->
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->
The feature provides administration and management functionalities for floating disks.
A floating disk should behave as a flexible independent entity that can be attached to any VM.<BR>
Any virtual disk can be in a floating state - by unattaching the disk from the VM/s.

== Benefit to oVirt ==
The feature introduces a significant improvement to oVirt compatibility and flexabilty regarding disks usage.<BR>
Supporting a floating state for disks is essential to derived features (e.g. 'Shared RAW Disk' and 'Direct LUN Disk')<BR>
and dependent implementations (e.g. application clustering, shared data warehouse).
