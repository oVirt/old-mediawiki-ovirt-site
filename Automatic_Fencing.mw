= Automatic Fencing =

oVirt engine can automatically fence hosts that fail to respond.
In order for fencing to run, there are 3 requirements:
# Fencing is configured and enabled on the host.
# There is a valid proxy host (another host in the same data-center in UP status).
# connection to the host has timed out:
#* on '''first''' network failure, host status will change to '''connecting'''
#* then engine will try 3 times more to ask vdsm for status (configuration: VDSAttemptsToResetCount) or wait an interval of time that depends on host's load (configured by the the config values  TimeoutToResetVdsInSeconds[deafult 60sec] + (DelayResetPerVmInSeconds[default 0.5sec]*(the count of running vms on host) + (DelayResetForSpmInSeconds[default 20sec]*(1 if host runs as SPM or 0 if not)).)
#* '''The longer of which''' - for example if vdsm hangs then 3 times may take up to 9 mins
#* if the host doesn't respond during this time, it's status will change to '''non responsive''' and it will be fenced.

more information:
* in case fencing fails (couldn't restart the host for example) there is no retry, host will stay in non-responsive status.
* during engine startup fencing is disabled, there is a configuration to set the time from the startup in which fencing is disabled: 'DisableFenceAtStartupInSec' default is 300 seconds
* once host is rebooted, it's status is moved to reboot for configurable time: 'ServerRebootTimeout' default is 300 seconds

= Troubleshooting =
Check that you can run the fence agent from the command line. Use the fence script that corresponds with the fence type you are setting up.

* fence_drac5 
** When testing make sure to use the "--action=status" parameter.
** The secure option in ovirt is equivalent to the "-- ssh" command line
** Verify the command prompt, Drac 6 requires a "--command-prompt=admin" parameter, note the command line parameter and the STDIN parameter are different for this option
** If your drac is slow to respond try adding a login-timeout option
