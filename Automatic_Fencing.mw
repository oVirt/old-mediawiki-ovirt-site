= Automatic Fencing =

oVirt engine can automatically fence hosts that fail to respond.
In order for fencing to run, there are 3 requirements:
# Fencing is configured and enabled on the host.
# There is a valid proxy host (another host in the same data-center in UP status).
# connection to the host has timed out:
#* on '''first''' network failure, host status will change to '''connecting'''
#* then engine will try 3 times more to ask vdsm for status (configuration: VDSAttemptsToResetCount) or 60 seconds (configuration: TimeoutToResetVdsInSeconds)
#* '''The longer of which''' - for example if vdsm hangs then 3 times may take up to 9 mins
#* if the host doesn't respond during this time, it's status will change to '''non responsive''' and it will be fenced.

more information:
* in case fencing fails (couldn't restart the host for example) there is no retry, host will stay in non-responsive status.
* during engine startup fencing is disabled, there is a configuration to set the time from the startup in which fencing is disabled: 'DisableFenceAtStartupInSec' default is 300 seconds
* once host is rebooted, it's status is moved to reboot for configurable time: 'ServerRebootTimeout' default is 300 seconds
