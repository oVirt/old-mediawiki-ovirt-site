For the moment, this is just a link dump - there is lots of information about releases which hasn't been organoised as far as I can tell.

This page should ideally have a checklist of things we need to do before a release, including:
* Release notes
* Release announcement
* Communication plan
* Release talking points which can be used as the basis for review articles
* Collected links related to the release

The [http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/branches/scons-build-system/www/release-process.html Subversion release procedure] covers a lot of the points of best practice in the area of doing a release.

== Generic materials ==

* [[Release Notes Template]]
* [[Release Process]] - could have more points related to the actual pushing out of the release and publicising it

== oVirt 3.1 release materials ==

* [[Release Notes Draft]] (should have the version in the name)
* [[Second Release]]
* Release announcement
* Press plan

== oVirt 3.0 release materials ==

* [[Release Notes]]  (should have the version in the name)
* [[First Release]]
