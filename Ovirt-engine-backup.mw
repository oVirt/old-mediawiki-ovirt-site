=== Detailed Description ===
Scripting language: BASH
Backup logic:
 * Create Temporary directory
 * Copy configuration files into temp directory
    1. /etc/ovirt-engine/  (ovirt engine configuration)
    2. /etc/sysconfig/ovirt-engine (ovirt engine configuration)
    3. /etc/exports.d  (NFS export created on setup)
    4. /etc/pki/ovirt-engine (ovirt-engine keys)
    5. Firewall
    6. Other
  * Create tar file from that directory
  * Create database backup using pgdump (database configuration should be read from /etc and written into temporary .pgpass file)

Restore:
Phase one (BASH)
1. Request user to run engine-setup
2. Override DB and PKI directories

Phase two (??)
1. Gather all needed information from the backup
2. Run otopi based ovirt-engine-setup with special parameters (use pgdump, don't create new PKI)

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
* Easy to use backup utility
* Easy restore of existing environments.
