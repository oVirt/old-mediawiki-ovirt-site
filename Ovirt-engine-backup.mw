=== Detailed Description ===
Backup logic:
 * Create Temporary directory
 * Copy configuration files into temp directory
    1. /etc/ovirt-engine/  (ovirt engine configuration)
    2. /etc/sysconfig/ovirt-engine (ovirt engine configuration)
    3. /etc/exports.d  (NFS export created on setup)
    4. /etc/pki/ovirt-engine (ovirt-engine keys)
    5. Firewall
    6. Other
  * Create tar file from that directory
  * Create database backup using pgdump (database configuration should be read from /etc and written into temporary .pgpass file)

Restore:
Phase one (BASH)
 1. Request user to run engine-setup
 2. Override DB and PKI directories

Phase two (??)
 * Gather all needed information from the backup
 *  Run otopi based ovirt-engine-setup with special parameters (use pgdump, don't create new PKI)

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
* Easy to use backup utility
* Easy restore of existing environments.

  --file=FILE                file to use during backup or restore
  --log=FILE                 log file to use
  --change-db-credentials    activate the following options, to restore
                             the database to a different location etc.
                             If used, existing credentials are ignored.
  --db-host=host             set database host
  --db-port=port             set database port
  --db-user=user             set database user
  --db-passfile=file         set database password - read from file
  --db-password=pass         set database password
  --db-password              set database password - interactively
  --db-name=name             set database name
  --db-secured               set a secured connection
  --db-secured-validation    validate host
 
  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
 
  OVIRT_ENGINE_DATABASE_PASSWORD
      Database password as if provided by --db-password=pass option.
 
  To create a new user/database:
 
  create user <user> password '<password>';
  create database <database> owner <user> template template0
  encoding 'UTF8' lc_collate 'en_US.UTF-8 lc_ctype 'en_US.UTF-8';
 
  Open access in the firewall/iptables/etc. to the postgresql port,
  5432/tcp by default.
 
  Locate pg_hba.conf within your distribution,
  common locations are:
   - /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
   - /etc/postgresql-*/pg_hba.conf
   - /etc/postgresql/*/main/pg_hba.conf
 
  and open access there by adding the following lines:
 
  host    <database>      <user>          0.0.0.0/0               md5
  host    <database>      <user>          ::0/0                   md5
 
  Replace <user>, <password>, <database> with appropriate values.
