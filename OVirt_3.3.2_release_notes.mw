{{DISPLAYTITLE:oVirt 3.3.2 release notes}}

The oVirt Project is preparing oVirt 3.3.2 beta release for testing. This page is still a work in progress.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the [[oVirt 3.3.1 release notes]], [[oVirt 3.3 release notes]], [[oVirt 3.2 release notes]] and [[oVirt 3.1 release notes]].
For a general overview of oVirt, read [[oVirt 3.0 Feature Guide | the oVirt 3.0 feature guide]] and the [[about oVirt]] page.

= What's New in 3.3.2? =

== VM creation "Guide Me" sequence ==

The ability to add VM network interfaces has been dropped from the New VM "Guide Me" sequence, as they can now be added/removed directly in the New VM dialog. As always, administrators are encouraged to maintain templates which include networking configurations commonly used in their deployments of oVirt; for special cases, networking should now be configured in the New VM dialog instead of the "Guide Me" sequence.
