{{DISPLAYTITLE:oVirt 3.3.2 release notes}}

The oVirt Project is preparing oVirt 3.3.2 beta release for testing. This page is still a work in progress.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the [[oVirt 3.3.1 release notes]], [[oVirt 3.3 release notes]], [[oVirt 3.2 release notes]] and [[oVirt 3.1 release notes]].
For a general overview of oVirt, read [[oVirt 3.0 Feature Guide | the oVirt 3.0 feature guide]] and the [[about oVirt]] page.

= Install / Upgrade from previous versions=

== BETA RELEASE ==
oVirt 3.3.2 is still in beta. In order to install it you've to enable oVirt beta repository.

If you're going to test  oVirt 3.3.2 beta, please add yourself to [[Testing/Ovirt 3.3.2 testing]].

== Fedora / CentOS / RHEL ==
If you're installing oVirt 3.3.2 on a clean host you should read our [[Quick Start Guide]]

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.3 you should just execute:
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
 # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.2 you should read [[oVirt 3.2 to 3.3 upgrade]]

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.1 you should upgrade to 3.2 before upgrading to 3.3.1.
Please read [[oVirt 3.1 to 3.2 upgrade]] before starting the upgrade.<br>
On CentOS and RHEL:
For upgrading to 3.2 you'll need 3.2 stable repository.<br>
So, first step is disable 3.3 / stable repository and enable 3.2 in /etc/yum.repos.d/ovirt.repo:

 [ovirt-32]
 name=Stable builds of the oVirt 3.2 project
 baseurl=http://ovirt.org/releases/3.2/rpm/EL/$releasever/
 enabled=1
 skip_if_unavailable=1
 gpgcheck=0

Then
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
should install  ovirt-engine-setup-3.2.3-1.el6.noarch.rpm<br>
if you have already updated to 3.3.x please use distro-sync or downgrade instead of update.<br>
Then:
 # engine-upgrade
this will upgrade your system to latest 3.2.<br>
Once you've all working on 3.2, enable 3.3/stable repository, then just
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
 # engine-setup
will upgrade to latest 3.3.

= What's New in 3.3.2? =

== VM creation "Guide Me" sequence ==

The ability to add VM network interfaces has been dropped from the New VM "Guide Me" sequence, as they can now be added/removed directly in the New VM dialog. As always, administrators are encouraged to maintain templates which include networking configurations commonly used in their deployments of oVirt; for special cases, networking should now be configured in the New VM dialog instead of the "Guide Me" sequence.

== Backup and Restore API for Independent Software Vendors ==

oVirt now provides an API set for Independent Software Vendors to backup and restore virtual machines.<br>
For backup, a snapshot of a virtual machine's disk is created then attached to a virtual appliance.<br>
For restore, disks are attached to a virtual appliance, the data is restored to the disks, then the disks are attached to a virtual machine.<br>
