{{DISPLAYTITLE:oVirt 3.3.4 release notes}}

The oVirt Project is preparing oVirt 3.3.4 beta release for testing. This page is still a work in progress.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the  [[oVirt 3.3.3 release notes]], [[oVirt 3.3.2 release notes]] , [[oVirt 3.3.1 release notes]], [[oVirt 3.3 release notes]], [[oVirt 3.2 release notes]] and [[oVirt 3.1 release notes]].

= Install / Upgrade from previous versions=

== BETA RELEASE ==
oVirt 3.3.4 is still in beta. In order to install it you've to enable oVirt beta repository.

If you're going to test  oVirt 3.3.4 beta, please add yourself to [[Testing/Ovirt 3.3.4 testing]].

== Fedora / CentOS / RHEL ==
If you're installing oVirt 3.3.4 on a clean host you should read our [[Quick Start Guide]]

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.3 you should just execute:
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
 # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.2 you should read [[oVirt 3.2 to 3.3 upgrade]]

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.1 you should upgrade to 3.2 before upgrading to 3.3.4.
Please read [[oVirt 3.1 to 3.2 upgrade]] before starting the upgrade.<br>
On CentOS and RHEL:
For upgrading to 3.2 you'll need 3.2 stable repository.<br>
So, first step is disable 3.3 / stable repository and enable 3.2 in /etc/yum.repos.d/ovirt.repo:

 [ovirt-32]
 name=Stable builds of the oVirt 3.2 project
 baseurl=http://ovirt.org/releases/3.2/rpm/EL/$releasever/
 enabled=1
 skip_if_unavailable=1
 gpgcheck=0

Then
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
should install  ovirt-engine-setup-3.2.3-1.el6.noarch.rpm<br>
if you have already updated to 3.3.x please use distro-sync or downgrade instead of update.<br>
Then:
 # engine-upgrade
this will upgrade your system to latest 3.2.<br>
Once you've all working on 3.2, enable 3.3/stable repository, then just
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
 # engine-setup
will upgrade to latest 3.3.
