==== Entity Description ====

===== GlusterHook =====

GlusterHook is the entity that represents the gluster hook in the cluster. It has the following properties

# Gluster command
# Stage
# Hook name (script name)
# Hook status (Enabled, Disabled, Missing)
# Content type (Binary/Text)
# Checksum
# Content text (Stored only in case type is non-binary)
# Conflict Status

Conflict Status is a 3 bit representation of the conflicts found between servers for the hook.
* Bit 1 - set if there's conflict in content
* Bit 2 - set if there's conflict in status
* Bit 3 - set if the hook script is missing in one of the servers

===== GlusterServerHook =====

GlusterServerHook entity represents the hook's properties in each server of the cluster. 
Properties :
# Hook Id
# Server Id
# Hook Status
# Content type
# Checksum

Note that the content of each server's hook is not stored in the engine. It is retrieved from the server when required (while resolving conflicts betweek hook scripts)

==== CRUD ====

* Gluster Hooks are added whenever a cluster is imported. The hooks that exist in the cluster will be added to the database.
* Gluster Hooks are also added as part of a routine sync operation. There will be a periodic job that looks for new hooks in cluster. If found, the database will be updated with the new hook details

==== Installation/Upgrade ====
<!-- Describe how the feature will effect new installation or existing one. -->

==== User work-flows ====
<!-- Describe the high-level work-flows relevant to this feature. -->

* On click of a gluster supported cluster, a Gluster Hooks sub-tab is shown which lists the hooks in the cluster.
* An admin should be able to enable/disable a hook on all nodes in the cluster by selecting it.
*  Content of the hook can be viewed by clicking the 'View Contents' button if the hook content type in 'Text'.
* An 'Exclamation' against a hook denotes, there is a  conflict in hook content/status across the servers in the cluster
* If there are conflicts in hook scripts across the servers in the cluster, administrator will have the option to resolve it. This will open a new window for conflict resolution.

==== Resolving the Conflicts ====

As the hooks present in the servers are periodically synchronized with engine database, there may be a chance of conflicts of the following types
* Content Conflict - content of the hook is different across servers
* Status Conflict -  status of the hook is different across servers
* Content + Status Conflict - both content and status of the hook is different across servers
* Missing - One or more servers of the cluster doesn't have the hook

==== Events ====
<!-- What events should be reported when using this feature. -->
* Periodic polling for hooks will report changes in hook and new hook scripts found in the events manager
