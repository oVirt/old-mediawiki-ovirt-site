Engine tools are mainly standlone java programs wrapped-up by scripts and mostly using the engine libraries 

= Tools list =
#engine-manage-domains
#engine-config
#engine-notifier
#engine-iso-uploader
#engine-logcollector
#generate-ssh-keys
#store-utils.sh

== Tools description == 
==engine-manage-domains==
Using this tool it is possible to add new authentication domains to serve as resource for users authenticating to oVirt engine.

How to get the tool:
The tool is installed when engine is installed.

How to configure the tool:
You can edit the configuration located at /etc/ovirt-engine/engine-manage-domains/engine-manage-domains.conf

How to run the tool;
Running basic example:
'engine-manage-domains add --domain=<MY_DOMAIN> --provider=<ad/ipa/oldap/itds/rhds> --user=<USERNAME>' 

==engine-config==
Using this tool it is possible to alter engine's  configuration 

How to get the tool:
The tool is installed when engine is installed.

How to configure the tool:
You can edit the configuration located at /etc/ovirt-engine/engine-config/engine-config.conf

How to run the tool;
Running basic example:
'engine-config -l' - will show you list of properties that can be alttered
'engine-config-g <property_name>' - will show you the value of a property
'engine-config-s <property_name>=<property_value>' - will alter the value of a property


==ovirt-iso-uploader==
The ovirt-iso-uploader can be used to list the names of ISO storage domains (not the images stored in those domains) and upload files to storage domains. The upload operation supports multiple files (separated by spaces) and wildcarding. The engine-iso-uploader will, by default, attempt to interact with the REST API.

==engine-image-uploader==
Using  the  engine-image-uploader  command,  you  can  list  export storage domains and upload virtual machines in Open Virtualization Format (OVF) to a oVirt Engine. The tool only supports OVF (ova)  files created by oVirt.

'''How to get the uploader:'''
<br>
The uploader is pulled in by ovirt-engine when the engine is installed via rpm.

In case it didn't :

'yum install ovirt-image-uploader'

In developer environment when not installing the engine via rpm, the uploader's rpm can be downloaded and installed from here (latest stable):
 http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.4/rpm/
<br>

'''How to configure the uploader:'''<br>
1. First, make sure the ovirt-engine is running and that it has an export domain that is up.<br>
2. The uploader has several configuration options which can be seen by doing<br>
'man engine-image-uploader'

<br>
The basic/minimal parameters that need to be filled prior to running the uploader are user,password and host:port of the engine.
Those parameters should be configured in:<br>
'/etc/ovirt-engine/imageuploader.conf'

'''How to run the uploader:'''<br>
Running basic example:<br>
'engine-image-uploader  -e <exportDomainName> --name <howToCallTheApplianceInOvirt>  upload <ova/ovf file name>'

==ovirt-log-collector==
The engine-log-collector command gathers data from many different components (logs, databases, and environmental information) associated with an instance of a oVirt Enterprise Virtualization Engine Manager. The tool is intended to be run from the Linux system on which the is running as the root user.

== Tools TODO ==
#standardize all tools usage and make it consistent
#create common infra both for java programs and for the wrapping scripts e.g functions to fulfill classpath dependencies etc.
#use comon paths for all
#Use a single logger library (apache-commons-logging)
