{{Feature|name=Avoid IP Spoofing|modules=engine,network,vdsm|status=Planning|version=}}

== Summary ==
We should limit traffic that originates from an non-trusted guests to a closed set of source IP addresses.

== Detailed Description ==
Now that [[Features/Cloud-Init_Integration]] is available, users have the ability to set the IP address of their guest from within Engine. However, nothing binds a rogue guest to do as it wishes, and impersonate 173.255.252.138 (current address of www.ovirt.org). With this feature implemented, administrators could apply stricter security rules that avoids that.


== Benefit to oVirt ==
When used to host a public cloud, oVirt should trust its guest operating less, and protect the local network from impersonation.

== Dependencies / Related Features ==
This small feature is a follow-up of [[Features/Cloud-Init_Integration]] and of [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/809814 Bug 809814 Add nwfilter rules to all VMs]

== Implementation ==

=== UI ===
On the [http://www.ovirt.org/File:Cloud-init-webadmin-screenshot.png "cloud-init" dialog], where IP addresses can be set, we shall add another checkbox labeled "restrict".

=== Engine core ===
When a new VM is defined, the user-supplied IP addresses (and boot protocol) should be kept per vNIC.
For each vNIC with the "restrict" checkbox set, Engine would request the "clean-traffic" filter, and would supply the relevant parameters (CTRL_IP_LEARNING=dhcp, or a list of IP addresses).

=== Vdsm ===
When defining interface devices (in the create and hotplug verbs), a filter name can already be supplied. To the filter, we should add the ability to pass a list of keys and values.

== Documentation / External references ==
Is there upstream documentation on this feature, or notes you have written yourself?  Link to that material here so other interested developers can get involved. Links to RFEs.

== Testing ==

* Start a VM with anti-spoofing on, and verify that it cannot emit illegitimate traffic.
* Start a VM defined before this feature is introduced, and verify that it can still emit any IP traffic

== Comments and Discussion ==
* Setting IP filtering has costs on the host's CPU and latency. Despite that, and due to the security implications, the default value for new VMs would be to filter IP traffic.
* Existing VMs, which have been defined by previous versions of oVirt do not have filtering set for them. This should be maintained during upgrade, as the guest may depend on this fact.
* If no IP address was defined, traffic would be unfiltered.
* There is an open issue on how to map the cloud-init identity of vNIC to libvirt's identity thereof. The problem exists regardless of this feature, but may become more acutic.
