==Summary==

A gluster storage administrator would like to view the capacity information (total , used and free) on a volume. This feature provides support for that.

== Current Status ==

* Status: Development in progress
* Last updated date: {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}<!--This is markup for current date, do not change-->

== Detailed Description ==
This feature helps the user to know the volume capacity information. Capacity information will be shown in the Volumes tab and it will be updated in background by the Ovirt Engine.

== Dependencies / Related Features ==

== User Flows ==
To view Gluster Volume Capacity,
User goes to "Volumes" tab where capacity information will be displayed as part of each volume row. A new column 'Capacity' will be shown just  before the 'Activities' column. Capacity information will be shown as graphic with total space available and percentage of usage ,etc.

== Getting the volume capacity details ==
The possibility for determining the volume capacity details are as below -

=== Using libgfapi ===
In this approach VDSM uses the APIs from libgfapi to get the details of a gluster volume. There are certain issues with the said API and not opting for using this option.
=== By mounting the volume and running "df" command ===
In this approach VDSM mounts the gluster volume first and then uses the "df" command to get the volume capacity details. This approach is bit expensive but foolproof. Opted to use this approach and go ahead.

=== By collating details from advanced volume details ===
In this approach VDSM needs to collate the details from advanced details of the volume and populate the capacity details. This approach would be light weight. Planning to migrate to this approach at later stage as more details like raw capacity for volumes, bricks etc. are required.

== Detailed Design ==
=== Entities ===
==== Gluster_Volumes ====
Following three columns will be added to gluster_volumes table.
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Column
! Type
! Description
|-
| totalSize
| long
| total volume size
|-
| freeSize
| long
| free volume size
|-
| usedSize
| long
| used volume size
|}

==== GlusterVolumeSizeInfo ====
  A new entity GlusterVolumeSizeInfo will be added to GlusterVolumeEntity. 
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Column
! Type
! Description
|-
| volumeId
| GUID
| respective gluster volume id
|-
| volumeName
| String
| Volume Name
|-
| totalSize
| long
| total volume size
|-
| freeSize
| long
| free volume size
|-
| usedSize
| long
| used volume size
|-
| updatedAt
| Date
|Capacity Info Lasted updated at
|}

=== Query ===
==== GetGlusterVolumeSizeInfoQuery ====
Makes a call to Gluster and get the volume capacity details. The details are returned into an instance of GlusterVolumeSizeInfo.

=== REST API ===

* Add statistics GET action on the gluster volume resource

 /api/clusters/{cluster-id}/glustervolumes/{volume-id}/statistics
This will return the volume capacity details. The details listed under volume capacity details would be -
* Free Size
* Used Size
* Total Size

The output format would look like -

<pre>
<statistics>
    <statistic id="{id}">
        <name>memory.total.size</name>
        <description>Total size</description>
        <values type="INTEGER">
            <value>
                <datum>{value}</datum>
            </value>
        </values>
        <type>GAUGE</type>
        <unit>BYTES</unit>
        <gluster_volume href="/ovirt-engine/api/clusters/{cluster-id}/glustervolumes/{volume-id}" id="{volume-id}"/>
    </statistic>
    <statistic id="{id}">
        <name>memory.free.size</name>
        <description>Free size</description>
        <values type="INTEGER">
            <value>
                <datum>{value}</datum>
            </value>
        </values>
        <type>GAUGE</type>
        <unit>BYTES</unit>
        <gluster_volume href="/ovirt-engine/api/clusters/{cluster-id}/glustervolumes/{volume-id}" id="{volume-id}"/>
    </statistic>
    <statistic id="{id}">
        <name>memory.used.size</name>
        <description>Used size</description>
        <values type="INTEGER">
            <value>
                <datum>{value}</datum>
            </value>
        </values>
        <type>GAUGE</type>
        <unit>BYTES</unit>
        <gluster_volume href="/ovirt-engine/api/clusters/{cluster-id}/glustervolumes/{volume-id}" id="{volume-id}"/>
    </statistic>
</statistics> 
</pre>
