== Description ==
Starting with oVirt 3.6.0 Hosted Engine can be deployed on a existing GlusterFS Replica 3 storage.
This test case will check that the feature is working as expected.

== Setup ==
* Prepare a Gluster Replica 3 storage to be used. You can follow  [https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Storage/2.1/html/Administration_Guide/sect-User_Guide-Setting_Volumes-Replicated.html Creating Replicated Volumes] guide
* Configure Gluster servers ensuring '''''/etc/glusterfs/glusterd.vol''''' setting
    option rpc-auth-allow-insecure on
* Configure the volume to be used as following:
   gluster volume set <volume> cluster.quorum-type auto
   gluster volume set <volume> network.ping-timeout 10
   gluster volume set <volume> auth.allow \*
   gluster volume set <volume> group virt
   gluster volume set <volume> storage.owner-uid 36
   gluster volume set <volume> storage.owner-gid 36
   gluster volume set <volume> server.allow-insecure on

==How to test==
# Install ovirt-hosted-engine-setup
# Run hosted-engine --deploy
# When asked about ''Please specify the storage you would like to use'' select glusterfs
# Specify the volume prepared for the test
# Complete the Hosted Engine deployment

==Expected Results==
