== Overview ==
oVirt web applications (i.e. WebAdmin and UserPortal) currently rely on GWT RPC mechanism to invoke operations and communicate with Engine backend. The exact RPC implementation in use, Direct-Eval RPC aka deRPC, [http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideServerCommunication.html#DevGuideDeRPC isn't officially supported anymore]; in fact, it never left "experimental" stage and is currently discouraged by GWT team.


Up to now, oVirt web UI used deRPC because it seemed to be the only GWT RPC implementation to fully support the kind of (Java) objects transferred between client and server. We've encountered [http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/19122/ problems] when trying to use [http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideServerCommunication.html#DevGuideCreatingServices standard GWT RPC implementation], some of them occuring at runtime and others occuring during GWT compilation phase.


More generally, oVirt web UI used GWT RPC mechanism because it allowed sharing same (Java) business entities and related objects between client and server. While seemingly convenient and easy at first, it led us into situation where client and server are coupled together by means of shared objects. GWT client and its RPC implementation target JavaScript runtime environments (i.e. web browser) and therefore impose various restrictions to such shared objects, which hinders the flexibility of Engine backend.


In addition to client/server coupling, the concept of using backend business entities in GWT client environment carries additional limitations, such as:
* cloning existing entity objects on client (manually copying all properties) whenever we need separate entity instance
* tricking GWT compiler into thinking that all shared code is live (i.e. shouldn't be pruned from generated JavaScript output) to avoid deserialization errors on server
* inability to introduce additional logic into entity objects beyond basic getters/setters and simple operations, considering both client and server perspective


Conceptually, data displayed (or otherwise acted upon) by client is different than data managed by server; each one is used to achieve different goals. For example, from backend perspective, a "Host" business entity might hold data (and possibly additional logic) to represent host machine entity as a whole, cohesive object with well-defined purpose and responsibility. On the other hand, from client perspective, displaying data such as "Host name and number of running VMs on that host" would naturally lead to creating different kinds of entity representations suitable for client to display (or otherwise act upon); reusing backend business entities like "Host" or "VM" therefore doesn't seem appropriate from client perspective.


Simply put, client and server each serve different purposes, so the underlying data representations should reflect their purposes as much as possible. Sharing data representations (entities) between client and server restricts both client and server; in our case, server drives entity design and client makes best effort to adapt to that design. However, this typically leads to problems such as client requesting frequent data updates from server and having to deserialize "heavy" objects just to display a small subset of their data to the user.


The main goal of utilizing Engine REST API in oVirt web UI is to decouple client from server while reusing standard API to invoke operations and communicate with Engine backend. In addition, this will bring following positive side effects:
* server having full control over backend business entities and related objects, unconstrained and independent from any client
* client having the freedom to use whatever data representation is suitable, based on raw data returned by Engine REST API
* less shared code means less code for GWT client to compile, improving compile times and reducing generated JavaScript footprint
* no need for GWT-specific hacks, such as tricking GWT compiler into thinking that all shared code is live
* not using Java <code>BackendLocal</code> interface directly, i.e. abstract away from query/action concept used internally by Engine backend
