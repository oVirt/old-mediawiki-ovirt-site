== Separate DWH Host ==

{{Feature|name=Separate DWH Host|modules=engine|status=Planning|version=3.5.0}}

=== Summary ===
Allow ovirt-engine-dwh to be installed and configured by engine-setup on a separate machine, without requiring ovirt-engine to be on the same host.

=== Owner ===

* Name: [[User:Didi| Didi]]

* Email: <didi@redhat.com>

=== Current status ===
In preparation.

=== Detailed Description ===
TBD:
* Need access to the engine's database - if db is setup locally, we might ask the user for the root password and ssh to get the credentials
* We might want to try and understand that from some engine status page first, to not bother the user. Do we need the engine's FQDN for other things?

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
DWH sometimes causes a significant load on the engine machine. Installing it on a separate machine will allow distributing the load.

=== Testing ===

Install and setup ovirt-engine on machine A, ovirt-engine-dwh on machine B, see that dwhd on B collects data from the engine on A.
