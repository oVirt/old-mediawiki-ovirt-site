== Separate DWH Host ==

{{Feature|name=Separate DWH Host|modules=engine|status=Design|version=3.5.0}}

=== Summary ===
Allow ovirt-engine-dwh to be installed and configured by engine-setup on a separate machine, without requiring ovirt-engine to be on the same host.

=== Current status ===
Design.

=== Detailed Description ===

We assume that engine is already setup and running on machine A. We assume that user wants to install dwh on machine B.

We need access to the engine's database. We'll let the user choose between two options:
* provide root password of machine A, ssh there, get the credentials
* manually supply the credentials

We need to also fix bug https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1059283 - check minimal ETL version, as we'll not be able to rely on package dependencies anymore.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
DWH sometimes causes a significant load on the engine machine. Installing it on a separate machine will allow distributing the load.

=== Testing ===

Install and setup ovirt-engine on machine A, ovirt-engine-dwh on machine B, see that dwhd on B collects data from the engine on A.
