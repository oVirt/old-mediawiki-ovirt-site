== Separate DWH Host ==

{{Feature|name=Separate DWH Host|modules=engine|status=Design|version=3.5.0}}

=== Summary ===
Allow ovirt-engine-dwh to be installed and configured by engine-setup on a separate machine, without requiring ovirt-engine to be on the same host.

=== Owner ===

* Name: [[User:Didi| Didi]]

* Email: <didi@redhat.com>

=== Current status ===
Implemented, should be available in 3.5.

=== Detailed Description ===

We assume that engine is already setup and running on machine A. We assume that user wants to install dwh on machine B.

We need access to the engine's database. If on separate host, user will be prompted for them.

We need to also fix bug https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1059283 - check minimal ETL version, as we'll not be able to rely on package dependencies anymore.

==Migrating an existing DWH and Reports installation==

For migration of an existing installation of DWH and Report to a different server please refer to:

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
DWH sometimes causes a significant load on the engine machine. Installing it on a separate machine will allow distributing the load.

=== Testing ===

Install and setup ovirt-engine on machine A, ovirt-engine-dwh on machine B, see that dwhd on B collects data from the engine on A.

On A:
 yum install ovirt-engine-setup
 engine-setup

On B:
 yum install ovirt-engine-dwh-setup
 engine-setup
