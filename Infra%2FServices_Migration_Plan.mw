= Infra team services migration plan =
The Infra team is planning to migrate all services to a new data center lab placed in pheonix, US.<BR>
This document will explain the phases for this migration and what and when each phase will include. <BR>
The migration is lead by David Caro <dcaro@redhat.com> and Eyal Edri <eedri@redhat.com> from the oVIrt Infra team.

== Phase I: Bringing the lab online  ==

==== Estimated finish date: 11/08/14 ====
* [DONE] Installing 2 nfs storage servers and setting up data mirroring using [http://www.drbd.org/ DRDB],and network bonding between them.
* [DONE] Setting up the firewall rules to allow maintainance and external access (managed by DC team at Red Hat)
* [DONE] Installing all hypervisors running fedora 19 (to allow nested virtualization)
* [DONE] Set up networking for all hosts, including bonding and switch configuration (done by local network team at Red Hat)
* [DONE] Setting up DNS for all servers, using ovirt.org domain.
* [DONE] Installing ovirt hosted engine 3.4.Z and running on multiple hypervisors for fail-safe if one hypervisor is down
* [DONE] Add all hypervisors to the hosted engine 
* [DONE] Add the nfs storage domain to hosted engine
* [DONE] Create 2 DataCenters: Jenkins & Production (see diagram)
* [DONE] Setting up DHCP, DNS, PXE via foreman-proxy to allow easy vm spawn and installation of operating systems.
* [DONE] Test connectivity to other ovirt resources (rackspace, alterway)
* [DONE] Add all bare-metal servers to foreman/puppet and ensure all authorized infra memebers have ssh access.
* Enure lab layout is documented and updated (including backup of network,fw configuration)

=== Phase II: Setting up Jenkins DC  ===
==== Estimated finish date: TBD ====
* Setting up a jenkins DC with 5 hypervisors
* Installing jenkins slaves with fedora/centos and starting testing jenkins jobs on them
* Installing nested hosts running feodra/centos and testing automation on them (probably in a different cluster)

=== Phase III: Decommision RACKSPACE  ===
==== Estimated finish date: TBD ====
* After verifying the new jenkins DC is capabale of running all our jenkins needs for the time being, remove all rackspace vms and stop the contract.

=== Phase IV: Start migration of production servers  to production DC ===
==== Estimated finish date: TBD ====
* Migrate production vms from alterway (gradually) 
* Migrate all services from resources.ovirt.org 
* Migrate jenkins server from alterway02 baremetal into production VM.
* Add the alterway bare metal servers as hypervisors (dc/cluster is TBD)
* Optional: migrate gerrit server from amazon into production DC
