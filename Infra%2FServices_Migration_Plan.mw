=== Phase I: Bringing the lab online  ===
== Estimated Date: 11/08/14 ==
* Installing 2 nfs storage servers and setting up data mirroring using [http://www.drbd.org/ DRDB], and bonding between 
* Setting up the firewall rules to allow maintainance and external access (managed by DC team at Red Hat)

* Setting up DHCP, DNS, PXE via foreman-proxy
* Test connectivity to other ovirt resources (rackspace, alterway)
* Add all bare-metal servers to foreman/puppet and ensure all authorized infra memebers have ssh access.
* Enure lab layout is documented and updated (including backup of network,fw configuration)

=== Phase II: Setting up Jenkins DC  ===
* Setting up a jenkins DC with 5 hypervisors
