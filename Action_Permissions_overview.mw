== Abstract ==
This is and overview and a how-to for developers. It should give a good idea about how <br>
permissions are build into the backend archetecture and how to add/update autorization to commands and entities.

== Terminology ==

* Permission
The building block in authorization which is composed from the target Object, User, and Role Ids.

       Permission
      /     |     \
   Object  User   Role

* Role
Role is Action groups container. A role can also be associated as a USER/ADMIN type. ADMIN roles
have Action Groups which USER dont

* PreDifined Roles
SuperUser, DataCenterAdmin are examples of predefined roles inserted during installation to DB. They could be edited.
for the list of full predefind roles see PredefinedRoles.java and dbscripts/insert_predefined_roles.sql

* Action Group
group of Actions

* Action
The basic building block. Every Command in the engine is an Action and has a unique ID given in the VdcActionType.java

* MLA - multi level administration. 
To make a long story short it was the initial name of the permission feature in the engine. At first there was no <br>
authorization on actions (woohoo!) so a special UI was designed to enforce it and its name was "Multi Level Administration Portal"
