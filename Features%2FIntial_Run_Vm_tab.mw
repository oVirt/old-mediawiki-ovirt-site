in code review...

=== Detailed Description ===
This feature emereged from the need to set the HW clock for non-windows machine in the first time the VM runs and store it in templates and their instances.<br>
To do so we must use the Timezone offset from GMT in seconds and send it to VDSM:

 <clock offset="variable" adjustment="-3600">
   <timer name="rtc" tickpolicy="catchup">
 </clock>


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
First an admin can set a VM with a desired clock offset, make a template from it and each VM created from that templte will have its clock
set already.
Second we would be able to use future sysprep for linux.
