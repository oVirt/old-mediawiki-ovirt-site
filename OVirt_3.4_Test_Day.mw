==Objective==
* engage project users and stakeholders to a hands-on experiences with oVirt new release.
* improve the quality of oVirt.
* Introduce and validating new oVirt 3.4 features


==What I should do==

*If you already have the hardware, verify if it meets the hardware requirement, refer information detail section below
* Write down the configuration you used (HW, console, etc) and what you've tested in the [http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.4-testday-1 report etherpad]
*Go ahead and  [[oVirt_3.4_Test_Day#Installation_notes| install ovirt ]]
* Follow the documentation to setup your environment, and test drive the new features.
* Please remember we expect to see some issues, and anything you come up with will save a you when you'll install final release
* Remember to try daily tasks you'd usually do in the engine, to see there are no regressions.
*Accomplish the goals set in objective section ,  run the tests,  update the test matrix.
*Running into any issues?
**  [[Community | Try to get help from the community ]] on #ovirt IRC channel or
**  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=oVirt open a bugzilla] ticket or
**  Report it on the [http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/3.4-testday-1 report etherpad]

==Installation notes==

* Make sure you have either a Fedora 19 or CentOS 6.5 machine installed.
* Install the release pkg: 
 (f19) sudo yum localinstall http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/ovirt-release-fedora-10.0.1-2.noarch.rpm
 (el) you need epel 1st - sudo yum localinstall http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
 then ovirt repo -   sudo yum localinstall http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/ovirt-release-el6-10.0.1-2.noarch.rpm
* follow [[OVirt_3.4.0_release_notes#Install_.2F_Upgrade_from_previous_versions | Install instructions in release notes]]
* guest agent rpms are available on http://evilissimo.fedorapeople.org/repos/ovirt-guest-agent/ovirt-3.4/beta1/ 
* the following oVirt Node ISO (based on CentOS 6.5 and oVirt 3.4 components) can be used for the Test Day. '''Important: You need to append enforcing=0 to the kernel when booting the ISO to prevent SELinux denials'''
 http://fedorapeople.org/~fabiand/node/3.0.4/ovirt-node-iso-3.0.4-TestDay.vdsm.el6.iso


===Known issues===

* A Fedora 19 node goes to "non operational" state with the error "Host IPADDRESS is compatible with versions (3.0,3.1,3.2,3.3) and cannot join Cluster Default which is set to version 3.4.". The recommended fix is to enable the fedora-virt-preview repo, delivered with the ovirt-release , and to update libvirt from it. ({{BZ|1056918||)

==Regression testing==

===General===
You need at least two physical servers to install and configure a basic yet complete oVirt environment with shared storage to exercise the following:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Scenario !! Bugs
|-
| Setup oVirt engine using either Active Directory or Local IPA, two hosts configured as hypervisors (Fedora / Ovirt-Node / other) with power management (Storage Domains - Data Domain / ISO Domain and Export Domain) ||
|-
| Setup oVirt engine  -  basic AIO flow || 
|-
| Use ISO Uploader to populate images of OS and tools ||
|-
| Basic Network Configuration ||
|-
| Create virtual machines and assign them to users ||
|-
| Migrate Virtual Machines between the hypervisors ||
|-
| Collect log file using the log collector tool ||
|-
| Upgrade from 3.3 to 3.4 ||  
|-
|}

===Configuration===
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Scenario !! Bugs
|-
| Configure high availability for virtual machines which are running mission critical workloads, so they  will be restarted on another host if hardware failure occurs ||
|-
| Use the multi-level administration feature to assign different levels of user permissions ||
|-
| Live Migration Scenarios ||
|-
| Enable smartcard support for a VM and verify that the <smartcard mode="passthrough" type="spicevmc"/> is passed to libvirt ||
|}

===Infra===
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Scenario !! Bugs
|-
| Start vdsm-3.4 after fresh install over rhel 6.5\rhel6.4\fedora 19\fedora 20 - check clear outputs and clear start - report in any misunderstanding of the startup process ||
|-
| Upgrade from vdsm-3.3 to vdsm-3.4 after running with vdsm 3.3, same for downgrade from 3.4 to 3.3 - verify that libvirtd configured and started properly ||
|-
| Check each vdsm-tool verbs of configurator module and its outputs - for misunderstanding of the output or the help instructions please report ||
|- 
| Add more that one domain using manage-domains. Check that login , search for users and groups  is working. Check that a a user belonging to a group can login if the group has permissions.||
|- 

|}

===Storage===
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Scenario !! Bugs
|-
| Use the General configuration as a base configuration ||
|-
| Create different types of storage domains (NFS, ISCSI, FC, local storage) with 2 or more data domains || 
|-
| Install at least 2 VMs on each of the Data Centers ||
|-
| Move the master domain to a different domain within the Data Center ||
|-
| Export one of the installed VMs, delete it, import it to another Data Center ||
|-
| Create a template from one of the VMs and then create a new VM based on this template ||
|-
| Move the newly created VM to another data domain ||
|-
| Create several snapshots from a VM (Each time change something in the guest) ||
|-
| Create several live snapshots from a VM (Each time change something in the guest) ||
|-
| Restore a previous snapshot ||
|-
| Live migrate a disk between storage domains ||
|-
| Storage Failovers ||
|-
| Host Failovers ||
|-
| Power User Portal provides power users the ability to create and manage virtual machines from the power user portal ||
|-
| High Availability scenarios provides instructions to configure virtual machine and host high availability ||
|}

===Network===
* Important Note: Known Fedora 19 bug: If the ovirtmgmt bridge is not successfully installed during initial host-setup, manually click on the host, setup networks, and add the ovirtmgmt bridge.
*Base config - single NIC, bridge on top, VMs attached to NIC
*Advanced configurations:
[[File:Vlan bonding.jpg]]
Make sure each of the configs can:
*Survive a reboot
*Test network at both host and VM level
*Ping and transfer large amounts of data (2Gb size files should be enough)
*Remain operational over time (1hr of uptime should be sufficient for the basic testing)

===Tools===
*Basic operations on iso-uploader:
# '''engine-iso-uploader list'''
# '''engine-iso-uploader upload <iso> -i <iso-domain-name> -v -f'''

* Basic operations on log-collector:
# '''engine-log-collector list'''
# '''engine-log-collector collect'''

*Basic operation on image-uploader
'''engine-image-uploader --name=<new name here> -e <domain> upload my.ovf'''

====New to v3.1:====
*port mirroring: one can setup a VM that sniffs all IP traffic between VMs on a network on a host.
*no mac spoofing: VMs cannot emit packets with spoofed mac address (unless specifically allowed to).
*Sync network: change network MTU (or other property) on host, verify that Engine may overwrite it with Sync network
*Jumbo packets: see if can be configured and used by storage

====New to v3.2:====
*Network main tab operational: you can search hosts and VM based on their network connectivity
*Guest agent reported devices: install guest agent on a VM and see it report internal information of the vNics (internal device name, IPv4 and IPv6)
*Network Linking: allow changing network the VM is connect to while it is running

===APIs===
by default we'll be using the webadmin as our API for testing
on this section we'll try to have default deployment with the different APIs
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Scenario !! Webadmin !! UserPortal !! Rest !! Python-SDK !! CLI
|-
| Create a data-center || || || ||  ||
|-
| Create a cluster || || || || || 
|-
| Update cluster || || || || || 
|-
| Install a host || || || || ||
|-
| Create a storage domain on DC || || || || ||
|-
| Attach export/ISO domain to DC || || || || ||
|-
| Create vm || || || || ||
|-
| Delete vm || || || || ||
|- 
| Import vm || || || || ||
|- 
| Start/hibernate/resume/stop vm || || || || ||

===SLA===
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! Scenario !! Steps !! Bugs
|-
|power saving policy powering off machines||Step 1:  Setup a cluster with at least two hosts including power management for both of them || 
|-
|||Step 2:  Edit cluster and set Power saving as the cluster policy ||
|-
|||Step 3:  Add hosts_in_reserve and enable_autopm parameters to the policy and set them to 1 and true ||
|-
|||Step 4:  Wait for some time and you should see one of the  hosts go to maintenance and after another minute or so move to Down ||
|-
|||Step 5:  Start a VM ||
|-
|||Step 6:  The host from step 4 should move to Unresponsive and and then to Up state. Both transitions take at least a minute so be patient. ||
|-
|||Verify: Repeat steps 4-6 but do not let the host shut down, start the VM when the host is in Maintenance, it should come up again ||
|-
|||Verify:  a) The SPM won't shut down b) there is always hosts_in_reserve hosts with no VMs or the cluster is using all the hosts ||
|-
|||Verify: With the auto_pm set to false in cluster policy, no host is shut down ||
|-
|||Verify: Disabling the automatic PM in the Host's power management tab keeps the host Up, but still counts it into the number of free hosts if there are no VMs running ||
|-
|||Verify: Host that was put to maintenance manually won't come up when the policy needs to wake up additional host ||
|-
|High Availability flag should be included when exporting/importing from Export Domain||Step 1:Have a VM marked as highly available. ||
|-
|||Step 2:  export the VM ||
|-
|||Step 3:  rename the original VM ||
|-
|||Step 4:  import the VM from step (2) ||
|-
|||Step 5:  Verify the imported VM is defined as highly available ||
|-
|Even Distribution Policy by number of VMs||Step 1: Create a cluster with at least 1 host ||
|-
|||Step 2: Set the VM_Evenly_Distributed as a cluster policy ||
|-
|||Step 3:  Add another host to the cluster ||
|-
|||Step 4:  After a while check if the VMs are evenly distributed to all hosts in the cluster (please note that one host is SPM and should have less VMs) ||
|-
|Make reservations for HA VMs to make sure there's enough capacity to start them if N hosts fail||Step 1: have 2 hosts and 2 running VMs on one of them.||
|-
|||Step 2:  Edit cluster policy and set HA reservations to "on" ||
|-
|||Step 3:  turn off the empty host. This should trigger an alert within ~3 minutes  about HA capacity. ||
