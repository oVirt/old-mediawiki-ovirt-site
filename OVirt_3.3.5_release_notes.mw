= Install / Upgrade from previous versions=

== NIGHTLY RELEASE ==
oVirt 3.3.5 is still in development. In order to install it you've to enable oVirt 3.3 snapshot repository

 # yum-config-manager --enable ovirt-3.3-snapshot
 # yum-config-manager --enable ovirt-3.3-snapshot-static

If you're going to test  oVirt 3.3.5 development version, please add yourself to [[Testing/Ovirt 3.3.5 testing]].

== Fedora / CentOS / RHEL ==
If you're installing oVirt 3.3.5 on a clean host you should read our [[Quick Start Guide]]

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.3 you should just execute:
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
 # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.2 you should read [[oVirt 3.2 to 3.3 upgrade]]

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.1 you should upgrade to 3.2 before upgrading to 3.3.4.
Please read [[oVirt 3.1 to 3.2 upgrade]] before starting the upgrade.<br>
On CentOS and RHEL:
For upgrading to 3.2 you'll need 3.2 stable repository.<br>
So, first step is disable 3.3 / stable repository and enable 3.2 in /etc/yum.repos.d/ovirt.repo:

 [ovirt-32]
 name=Stable builds of the oVirt 3.2 project
 baseurl=http://ovirt.org/releases/3.2/rpm/EL/$releasever/
 enabled=1
 skip_if_unavailable=1
 gpgcheck=0

Then
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
should install  ovirt-engine-setup-3.2.3-1.el6.noarch.rpm<br>
if you have already updated to 3.3.x please use distro-sync or downgrade instead of update.<br>
Then:
 # engine-upgrade
this will upgrade your system to latest 3.2.<br>
Once you've all working on 3.2, enable 3.3/stable repository, then just
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
 # engine-setup
will upgrade to latest 3.3.
