= Install / Upgrade from previous versions=

== CANDIDATE RELEASE ==
oVirt 3.3.5 candidate release is available. In order to install it you've to enable oVirt 3.3 pre release repository.

'''please wait for official announcement before trying to install it.'''

 # yum localinstall http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release.noarch.rpm
 # yum-config-manager --enable ovirt-3.3-prerelease

If you're upgrading from a previous version of oVirt you must also ensure to have 3.3 stable repository enabled for rollback support:

 # yum-config-manager --enable ovirt-3.3-stable

Since oVirt 3.4.0 has been released, in order to install 3.3.5 RC you need to disable latest stable an latest 3.4 repositories:

 # yum-config-manager --disable ovirt-stable
 # yum-config-manager --disable ovirt-3.4-stable

If you're going to test  oVirt 3.3.5 development version, please add yourself to [[Testing/Ovirt 3.3.5 testing]].

== Fedora / CentOS / RHEL ==
If you're installing oVirt 3.3.5 on a clean host you should read our [[Quick Start Guide]]

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.3 you should just execute:
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
 # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.2 you should read [[oVirt 3.2 to 3.3 upgrade]]

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.1 you should upgrade to 3.2 before upgrading to 3.3.5.
Please read [[oVirt 3.1 to 3.2 upgrade]] before starting the upgrade.<br>
On CentOS and RHEL:
For upgrading to 3.2 you'll need 3.2 stable repository.<br>
So, first step is disable 3.3 / stable repository and enable 3.2 in /etc/yum.repos.d/ovirt.repo:

 [ovirt-32]
 name=Stable builds of the oVirt 3.2 project
 baseurl=http://ovirt.org/releases/3.2/rpm/EL/$releasever/
 enabled=1
 skip_if_unavailable=1
 gpgcheck=0

Then
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
should install  ovirt-engine-setup-3.2.3-1.el6.noarch.rpm<br>
if you have already updated to 3.3.x please use distro-sync or downgrade instead of update.<br>
Then:
 # engine-upgrade
this will upgrade your system to latest 3.2.<br>
Once you've all working on 3.2, enable 3.3/stable repository, then just
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
 # engine-setup
will upgrade to latest 3.3.
