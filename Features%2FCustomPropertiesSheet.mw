== Custom Properties Sheet ==

=== Summary ===
The Custom Properties for a VM are edited in the GUI via the "Custom Properties" section within the New/Edit VM dialog.
Currently this section contains a plain text-box, which should be filled according to a very specific format.
In order to improve user experience, we want to beautify the "Custom Properties" section.

This is a pure GUI/UX feature
