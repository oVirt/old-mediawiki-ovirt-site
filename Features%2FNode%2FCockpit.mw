=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
Th main reason for this change it to adopt a common used UI for the oVirt Node.  <br/>
The use of such community supported framework will provide control of oVirt node in manner that is familiar to many users out of the oVirt community. <br/>
Additionally it provides a browser based control of the nodes which is much more user friendly then the current TUI. <br/>
Last but not least is the option of utilizing common code and reduce the amount of oVirt unique code.
