== Summary ==
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
Supervdsm should be responsible for all priviledged operations, but as supervdsm is started by unpriviledged vdsm, vdsm now does some priviledged operations. Aim of this feature is to get vdsm to be a pure unpriviledged process and move all privildged operations to supervdsm.

== Current status ==
*current solution<br />
# vdsmd.init start vdsm with user “vdsm” <br />
# launch supervdsm when it is not running<br />
# vdsm tries to call supervdsm<br />
# when authentication error, re-launch, others just raise<br />

*current problem<br />
# unprivileged vdsm and proxy need to call previleged “sudo launch” and “sudo kill”<br />
# redundent key between vdsm and supervdsm as they are parent and child<br />
# vdsm call supervdsm exception flow problems<br />

== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
*new proposal A:
# vdsmd.init starts vdsm as root
# vdsm forks supervdsm server and then drop privilege
# when vdsm exit, supervdsm probe vdsm heart beat stop and exit
# vdsm call supervdsm may discover supervdsm server exit, vdsm will exit itself and restart

*new proposal B:
# vdsmd.init starts supervdsm as root
# supervdsm forks vdsm

==Exception flows to consider==
*supervdsm server process has 3 parts:
# main thread
# supervdsm server thread(the one starts supervdsmServer manager)
# keep alive thread(let's assume this simple function will not cause exceptions)

*exception flows need attention(also future test cases)：
# one of supervdsm server export function raise error 
expected result: raise to proxy caller
# supervdsm main thread killed when calling
expected result: raise to proxy caller EOFError(current)</br>
		   vdsm restart all over(because vdsm lost privilege)
# supervdsm main thread killed before call
expected result:restart supervdsm and call(current)</br>
		vdsm restart all over(because vdsm lost privilege)
# supervdsm server thread killed(not started) before call
expected result: connection error will raised to proxy caller(current)</br>
                          connection error and then vdsm restart all over
# supervdsm server thread killed(not started) when call
expected result:current:TODO(/br)
                         new:TODO
# vdsm process died
expected result:current: supervdsm server will kill itself(seconds delay, careful of regression, bug related:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=890365)</br>
                         future: supervdsm server will kill itself and restart all over
