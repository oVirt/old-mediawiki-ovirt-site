== Summary ==
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
Supervdsm should be responsible for all priviledged operations, but as supervdsm is started by unpriviledged vdsm, vdsm now does some priviledged operations. Aim of this feature is to get vdsm to be a pure unpriviledged process and move all privildged operations to supervdsm.

== Current status ==
*current solution<br />
# vdsmd.init start vdsm with user “vdsm” <br />
# launch supervdsm when it is not running<br />
# vdsm tries to call supervdsm<br />
# when authentication error, re-launch, others just raise<br />

*current problem<br />
# unprivileged vdsm and proxy need to call previleged “sudo launch” and “sudo kill”<br />
# redundent key between vdsm and supervdsm as they are parent and child<br />
# vdsm call supervdsm exception flow problems<br />

== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
*new proposal A:[http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=vdsm.git;a=commit;h=976dbb13e6cd8136b12ed58ccd2a5176b730bddf patch for proposal A]
# vdsmd.init starts vdsm as root
# vdsm forks supervdsm server and then drop privilege
# when vdsm exit, supervdsm probe vdsm heart beat stop and exit
# vdsm call supervdsm may discover supervdsm server exit, vdsm will exit itself and restart

*new proposal B:[http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=vdsm.git;a=commit;h=033ef4bc73dbbb36dd8180049626e7f4cde56334 patch for proposal B]
# vdsmd.init starts supervdsm as root
# supervdsm forks vdsm

==Exception flows to consider==
*supervdsm server process has 4 parts:
# main thread
# supervdsm server thread(the one starts supervdsmServer manager)
# supervdsm server exported functions
# keep alive thread(let's assume this simple function will not cause exceptions)
item 1.2.4 mean supervdsm server framework problem, 1.2 need to be handled by restart supervdsmServer.


*exception flows need attention(also future test cases)：
# one of supervdsm server export function raise error 
#* expected result: raise to proxy caller 
# supervdsm main thread killed when calling
#* expected result: raise to proxy caller EOFError(now)
#* vdsm restart all over, because vdsm lost privilege(future)
# supervdsm main thread killed before call
#* expected result:restart supervdsm and call(current)
#* vdsm restart all over(future)
# supervdsm server thread killed(not started) before call
#* expected result: connection error will raised to proxy caller(current)
#* connection error and then vdsm restart all over(future)
# supervdsm server thread killed(not started) when call
#* expected result:current:TODO
#* new:TODO
# vdsm process died
#*expected result:current: supervdsm server will kill itself(seconds delay, careful of regression, bug related:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=890365)<br/>
#*future: supervdsm server will kill itself and restart all over

==Proposal comparison==
*exception flows need attention(also future test cases)：
# first launch
#* A: supervdsm server process lauched by priviledged vdsm, then vdsm drop priviledge
#* B: supervdsm server process lauched by vdsmd.init
# one of supervdsm server export function raise error 
#* A: just raise to Proxy Caller
#* B:just raise to Proxy Calller
# supervdsm main thread killed when calling
#* A: discover when call return EOFError and then restart 
#* vdsm restart all over, because vdsm lost privilege(future)
# supervdsm main thread killed before call
#* expected result:restart supervdsm and call(current)
#* vdsm restart all over(future)
# supervdsm server thread killed(not started) before call
#* expected result: connection error will raised to proxy caller(current)
#* connection error and then vdsm restart all over(future)
# supervdsm server thread killed(not started) when call
#* expected result:current:TODO
#* new:TODO
# vdsm process died
#*expected result:current: supervdsm server will kill itself(seconds delay, careful of regression, bug related:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=890365)<br/>
#*future: supervdsm server will kill itself and restart all over
