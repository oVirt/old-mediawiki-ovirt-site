* Email: <alkaplan@redhat.com>

=== Current status ===
* On Design
* Last update date: 04/11/2012

=== Detailed Description ===
==== Terminology ====
A vnic on a running VM can have 4 states (If the VM is down, its state represent its behavoiur when he"ll get up)
# Activte - Plugged & Connected- The Vnic is defined on the VM and connected to the Network.
# Plugged & Disconnected- The Vnic is defined on the VM and isn't connected to any network.
# Unpluged & Connected- The Vnic is not defined on the VM. When the Vnic will be plugged it will be automatically connected to the Network. 
# Unplugged & Disconnected- The Vnic is not defined on the VM.  When the Vnic will be plugged it won't be connected to any network.

==== GUI ====
==== Virtual Machines -> Network Interfaces sub tab ==== 
* '''Columns'''
:* Plugged- should be added after Name.
:* Connected- should be added after Network Name. 
:* Status (icon)- green if plugged and connected, red- otherwise. The tooltip should display the plugged and connected status. (TODO- Maybe should also combine the VM status)
* '''Actions'''
:* Activate/Deactivate-
::* Remove these actions from the subtab (The user will be able to control the Vnic's state through the add/edit Vnic dialogs)

:* Add
::* There would be an "on/off" switch next to the network combo. The switch will present if the network is connected or not. (TODO- add print screen)
::* "Activate" checkbox will be changed to a switch with two options "Plug/Unplug".

:* Edit
::* If the vm status is up
:::* The edit command should be enabled.
:::* If the vnic is active (plugged & connected) there should be a message in top of the dialog "Please notice, changing <b>Type</b> or <b>MAC</b> will cause plugging and unplugging the Vnic".
:::* Port Mirroring- If the vnic is plugged and there is port mirroring on the vnic- network, type, mac and port mirroring fileds in the dialog will be disabled.
::: Strech goal- enable hot changes in port mirroring (without plugging and unplugging)
::* There would be an "on/off" switch next to the network combo. 
::* Add "Plug/Unplug" switch to the dialog (same as in Add dialog).


==== REST API ====

NIC properties:


Changes:
* Adding new properties under VM NIC:
:* plugged
:* connected
* Deprecating the active property under VM NIC
* Deprecating activate/deactivate actions
* Plug/unplug and connect/disconnect on a vnic, will be done via post action on the VM NIC
There is no reason to have dedicated actions for plug/unplug or connect/disconnect.
The original reason for having them was that edit VM nic while the VM was up used to be blocked and now we'll enable doing these actions.
