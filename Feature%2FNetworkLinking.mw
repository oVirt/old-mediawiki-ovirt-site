* Last update date: 04/11/2012

=== Introduction ===
Currently oVirt engine supports configuring the VM network interface either on creation or updating it when the vnic is not in active state (or the VM is not running).<BR>
:* ovirt-engine already supports hot-plug and hot-unplug of vnics, however it lacks the capability of performing changes of the vnic once the vnic is plugged and to preserve the vnic PCI address.<BR>

==== High Level Feature Description ====
A vnic on a running VM can have 4 states (If the VM is down, its state represents how it should behave once started)
* '''Plugged'''
:* '''Connected''' - The Vnic is defined on the VM and connected to the Network.
:** Obsereved as the vnic is located on its slot and a network cable is connected to it.
:** This is the only state on which the state of the VM Network Interface is 'Active'.
:* '''Disconnected''' - The Vnic is defined on the VM and isn't connected to any network.
:** Obsereved as the vnic is located on its slot but no network cable is connected to it.
* '''Unplugged''' - at this state the vnic is defined on ovirt-engine only
:* '''Connected''' - once the Vnic is plugged it will automatically be connected to the Network and become 'Active'. 
:* '''Disconnected''' - once the Vnic is plugged it won't be connected to any network.

The ovirt-engine's user will be able to configure the Vnic state to any of the mentioned above by any of the following methods:
* API
* Admin portal
* User portal

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
The feature is an enhancement of the oVirt-engine Vnic management:
* Dynamically updating the Vnic configuration by the admin or by the user.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
The Network Permissions is dependent on the following features:
