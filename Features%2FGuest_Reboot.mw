= Guest Reboot (preview) =

== Summary ==

Support reboot in both engine and vdsm. Enable users to restart guest with single command.

== Detailed description ==

=== Current Condition ===

The current behavior in the engine requires the user who wishes to reboot VM to wait until the VM is <tt>Down</tt>, then press run and wait until it is <tt>Up</tt> again. 

Adding a new button/REST action (with configurable behavior, see later) would solve this issue.

=== Proposed changes ===

* Frontend 
* REST
* Backend
* VDSM
* Guest Agent

== Possible Issues ==
