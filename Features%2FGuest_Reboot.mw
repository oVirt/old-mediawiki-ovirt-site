= Guest Reboot (preview) =

== Summary ==

Support reboot in both engine and vdsm. Enable users to restart guest with single command.

== Detailed description ==

=== Current Condition ===

The current behavior in the engine requires the user who wishes to reboot VM to wait until the VM is <tt>Down</tt>, then press run and wait until it is <tt>Up</tt> again. 

Adding a new button/REST action (with configurable behavior, see later) would solve this issue.

=== Proposed changes ===

* Frontend 
:Add new button [[File:reboot.png|alt=Reboot icon]] in the main VM toolbar between the current stop and console buttons.
* REST
* Backend
* VDSM
* Guest Agent
:Support additional boolean parameter in the desktopShutdown call determining wether we want normal shutdown (<tt>reboot=False</tt>) or reboot (<tt>reboot=True</tt>). 
:This is the simplest change as it boils down to passing -h or -r flag to the underlying script performing the shutdown.

== Possible Issues ==

* Run Once behavior 
:Do we want to preserve the run-once configuration after reboot (effectively becoming "run-twice") or do we treat it as equivalent to stop(); start()? 
:Do we provide option to the user to select the desired behavior?

* Stateless VM
