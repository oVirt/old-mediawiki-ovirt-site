=== Detailed Description ===


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Libvdsm aims to stabilize the current vdsm API so that it can evolve in an orderly and backwards-compatible manner.  This is important because: we would like to expose the API for use by entities other than oVirt-engine, create out of tree vdsm connectors (Rest API, AMQP broker, etc), enable third-party access to the node-level API (for vendor plugins, etc), and have the ability to use vdsm in a standalone configuration.  Libvdsm benefits ovirt-engine as well because it formalizes the API and makes it easier to write against.


=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
None


=== Documentation / External references ===
The patch commit messages contain a lot of useful information on the design.
