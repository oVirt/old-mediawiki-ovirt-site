Vdsm's log files reside under <tt>/var/log/vdsm/</tt>

They are named <tt>vdsm.log(.\d+.xz)?</tt>.

''Notice that the logs are in lzma2 format, which is not-quite-standard but very efficient for log files.''

Log lines are in the format of:
 ThreadID/TaskID::ERROR_LEVEL::DATE TIME::FILE_NAME::LINE::LOGGER_NAME::(FUNCTION_NAME) MESSAGE
