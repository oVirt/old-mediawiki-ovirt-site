== What is the usage of DbFacadeLocator? ==
Create a datasource from the standalone.xml configuration<br>
Create the DbFacade instance and configure it<br>
Create a dialect<br>
Create a jdbcTemplate and associate it with the DbFacade instance<br>

== What is the usage of Db Facade? ==
Holds a map of all entity as a key and DAO implementation as a value.<br>
Used mainly to get a DAO object to work with<br>

== What is a dialect used for? ==
A dialect is used in order to handle in a generic way DB calls on multi DB engine applications<br>
We had used that in the past to handle both MS SQL & Postgres <br>
Example 
  A table T with columns c1 and c2 where c1 is the primary key
  Suppose that we have a getT(c1) function that returns a record that matches the key
  In Postgres function parameters can not have the same name as table columns so we will have to choose another name for c1 parameter.
  we can achieve that by defining the function as get(v_c1) and implementing getParamNamePrefix in the PostgresDbEngineDialect to add the "v_" prefix.

We will see that a dialect is also used in the search engine to identify and prevent SQL Injection

=== SQL Injection prevention. ===


== Trouble Shooting  ==

=== Can not connect to the database. ===
Check that you postgresql service is up<br>
If you are using remote database, check Postgres configuration for listening to remote connections<br>
Check JBOSS standalone.xml and verify that user/database<br> and all relevant settings are OK<br>
Check the JBOSS server log for detailed error message.
Check the postgres error log for detailed error message.<br>

=== JBoss is crashing on start giving a SQL Error  ===
Check server log
Check engine log
Compensation & async tasks data
Check schema version

=== My database is deleted each time I run the tests.  ===
Verify that your database engine name is not engine<br>
When you run mvn with tests the fixtures.xml is used to create a engine database for each test, this will drop and create your engine database.<br>
You can rename your default database in JBOSS standalone.xml configuration file.
