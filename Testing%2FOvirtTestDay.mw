== '''oVirt 3.2 test day''' ==

==Objective==

The purpose of test days initiative is to accomplish the following goals:

* Get multiple engineers and stakeholders to have hands-on opportunity to learn more about Ovirt functionality and features.
* Improve the quality of oVirt, towards its first release.
* Establish a quality baseline.
* Introducing and validating new oVirt 3.2 features 
* While learning about the project, the stakeholders can come with their own test cases, in different categories for regression testing:
**installation/migration from 3.1
**Storage
**Networking
**interfaces
**Spice
**User Interface
**Tools

in addition participate in exploring [[OVirt_3.2_release-management#Features|new features]] .

==Participants==

Test Days are open to anyone. If you have your own setup we will provide all the software packages and the required information. Please refer  -  What to do as a participant - in the section below, if you're willing to participate please add yourself to the below table:

==Test Dates==

The overall test dates are spread across multiple duration which are driven by the beta releases from the engineering. The following are the list of test days scheduled -
*JAN 18th, 2012  - First Release (3.0)
*Jun 14th, 2012 - Second Release (3.1)
*JAN 29th, 2013  - Third Release (3.2)


==Execution Plan and Guidelines==

The following is the list of categories which we would like to focus on.  this is basically regression testing:

===General===
You need at least two physical servers to install and configure a basic yet complete oVirt environment with shared storage to exercise the following:
{|border="1"
! Scenario !! Bugs
|-
| Setup oVirt engine using either Active Directory or Local IPA, two hosts configured as hypervisors (Fedora / Ovirt-Node / other) with power management (Storage Domains - Data Domain / ISO Domain and Export Domain) ||
|-
| Use ISO Uploader to populate images of OS and tools ||
|-
| Basic Network Configuration ||
|-
| Create virtual machines and assign them to users ||
|-
| Migrate Virtual Machines between the hypervisors ||
|-
| Collect log file using the log collector tool ||
|}

===Configuration===
{|border="1"
! Scenario !! Bugs
|-
| Configure high availability for virtual machines which are running mission critical workloads, so they  will be restarted on another host if hardware failure occurs ||
|-
| Use the multi-level administration feature to assign different levels of user permissions ||
|-
| Live Migration Scenarios ||
|}

===Storage===
{|border="1"
! Scenario !! Bugs
|-
| Use the General configuration as a base configuration ||
|-
| Create different types of storage domains (NFS, ISCSI, FC, local storage) with 2 or more data domains || 
|-
| Install at least 2 VMs on each of the Data Centers ||
|-
| Move the master domain to a different domain within the Data Center ||
|-
| Export one of the installed VMs, delete it, import it to another Data Center ||
|-
| Create a template from one of the VMs and then create a new VM based on this template ||
|-
| Move the newly created VM to another data domain ||
|-
| Create several snapshots from a VM (Each time change something in the guest) ||
|-
| Restore a previous snapshot ||
|-
| Storage Failovers ||
|-
| Host Failovers ||
|-
| Power User Portal provides power users the ability to create and manage virtual machines from the power user portal ||
|-
| High Availability scenarios provides instructions to configure virtual machine and host high availability ||
|}

===Network===

*Base config - single NIC, bridge on top, VMs attached to NIC
*Advanced configurations:
[[File:Vlan bonding.jpg]]
make sure each of the configs can:
*survive a reboot
*test network at both host and VM level
*ping and transfer large amounts of data (2Gb size files should be enough)
*remain operational over time (1hr of uptime should be sufficient for the basic testing)

====New to v3.2:====
*port mirroring: one can setup a VM that sniffs all IP traffic between VMs on a network on a host.
*no mac spoofing: VMs cannot emit packets with spoofed mac address (unless specifically allowed to).
*Network main tab operational: you can search hosts and VM based on their network connectivity
*Sync network: change network MTU (or other property) on host, verify that Engine may overwrite it with Sync network
*Jumbo packets: see if can be configured and used by storage

===APIs===
by default we'll be using the webadmin as our API for testing
on this section we'll try to have default deployment with the different APIs
{|border="1"
! Scenario !! Webadmin !! UserPortal !! Rest !! Python-SDK !! CLI
|-
| Create a data-center || || || ||  ||
|-
| Create a cluster || || || || || 
|-
| Update cluster || || || || || 
|-
| Install a host || || || || ||
|-
| Create a storage domain on DC || || || || ||
|-
| Attach export/ISO domain to DC || || || || ||
|-
| Create vm || || || || ||
|-
| Delete vm || || || || ||
|- 
| Import vm || || || || ||
|- 
| Start/hibernate/resume/stop vm || || || || ||
|-
| Create a snapshot to vm || || || || ||
|-
| Create a template from vm || || || || ||
|-
| Create vm from template || || || || ||
|-

In case you would like to test a product with a new test case, there is a template to be used for creating test cases. Please copy this template for the test case, and update the link in this document to point to the results table below.  It is not necessary that the person who is writing the test case will also be the person executing the test case,  please  make sure the instructions are  explicit enough that anyone who may want to participate in the test day  can follow them, and execute it.

==What to do as a participant==

*If you already have the hardware, verify if it meets the hardware requirement, refer information detail section below
*Update the  Participants section.
