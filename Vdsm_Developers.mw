==Building a Vdsm RPM==
Vdsm uses autoconf and automake as it's build system.
To configure the build env:
 ./autogen.sh --system

To create an RPM do:
 make rpm

Vdsm automatically builds using the latest tagged version. If you want to explicitly define a version use
 make rpmversion=4.9 rpmrelease=999.funkyBranch

==Code Style==
* variables and arguments are in mixedCase
* class names are in CamelCase
* all indentation is made of space characters
* a space character follows any comma
* spaces surround operators, but
* no spaces between
 def f(arg=its_default_value)
* lines longer than 80 chars are frowned upon
* whitespace between functions and within stanza help to breath while reading code
* a space char follows a comment's hash char
