==Getting the source==
Our public git repo is located on [http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=vdsm.git oVirt.org]

you can clone it with
 git clone http://gerrit.ovirt.org/p/vdsm.git

==Building a Vdsm RPM==
Vdsm uses autoconf and automake as it's build system.
To configure the build env:
 ./autogen.sh --system

To create an RPM do:
 make rpm

Vdsm automatically builds using the latest tagged version. If you want to explicitly define a version use
 make rpmversion=4.9 rpmrelease=999.funkyBranch

==Code Style==
* variables and arguments are in mixedCase
* class names are in CamelCase
* all indentation is made of space characters
* a space character follows any comma
* spaces surround operators, but
* no spaces between
 def f(arg=its_default_value)
* lines longer than 80 chars are frowned upon
* whitespace between functions and within stanza help to breath while reading code
* a space char follows a comment's hash char
* let logging method do the formatting for you:
 logging.debug('hello %s', 'world')
rather than
 logging.debug('hello %s' % 'world')

==Sending patches==
Send them to [http://gerrit.ovirt.org our gerrit server] ([[Working with oVirt Gerrit|see how]]). With your first major patch, do not forget to add yourself to the AUTHORS file. Do not be shy - it gives you a well-deserved recognition, and it shows to the team that you stand behind your code.

General development discussions are in <tt>vdsm-devel@lists.fedorahosted.org</tt>.
