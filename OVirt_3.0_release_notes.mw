The packaging & install subproject deals with the creation of the packages for the oVirt Engine and associated subcomponents. This subproject also delivers the ''engine-setup'' and ''engine-cleanup'' utilities. The ''engine-setup'' utilitiy is used to configure and remove oVirt Engine while the ''engine-cleanup'' utility is used to remove it.

* As JBoss AS7 does not follow symlinks, some files are currently copied in the %post section of the ovirt-engine package.([https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=782567 BZ#782567])
