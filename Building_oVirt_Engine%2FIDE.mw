== Using IDE for Ovirt Engine ==

=== Reason ===
Java IDE Is very much like Vegemite[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegemite];<br>
Some really really like it, some like it as Marmite[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmite] and some like it as Cenovis[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenovis].<br>
Others, simply can't stand the thought of it...

As for Java IDE, some like Eclipse, some like Net Beans,<br>
and others can't stand the thought of anything which is not '''VI'''.

This page is intended for those who would like to use some sort of<br>
a graphical development environmet, which does not requier the use<br>
of 'esc'+':' combination ;)

=== Eclipse ===

==== Use case ====
* Recommended due to JBoss integration.
* May be used with Pythone as well: http://wiki.python.org/moin/EclipsePythonIntegration
* Current Eclipse release is Indigo Service Release 1.
** Available from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
** Use the J2EE for developers.

==== Some more work... ====
* Fix maven version
<pre>
>> open Windows --> 
   Preferences --> 
   Maven --> 
   Installations
>> Choose 2.2 installation. If it's not there, use the 'add' button and add the path to your maven 2.2 installation.</pre>

* Install maven plugin to eclipse
** Note: Make sure you use m2e version 0.12.XXX as later versions do not work well with maven 2.2.
<pre>
>> open help --> 
   install new software --> 
   click 'add' and place the following url http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e 
>> check all components, install and restart eclipse at the end</pre>

* Import sources:
<pre>

   import --> 
   Maven -->
