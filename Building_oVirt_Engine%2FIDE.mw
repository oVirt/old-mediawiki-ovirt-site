== Using IDE for Ovirt Engine ==

=== Reason ===
Java IDE Is very much like Vegemite[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegemite];<br>
Some really really like it, some like it as Marmite[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmite] and some like it as Cenovis[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenovis].<br>
Others, simply can't stand the thought of it...

As for Java IDE, some like Eclipse, some like Net Beans,<br>
and others can't stand the thought of anything which is not '''VI'''.

This page is intended for those who would like to use some sort of<br>
a graphical development environmet, which does not requier the use<br>
of 'esc'+':' combination ;)

=== Eclipse ===
* Recommended due to JBoss integration.
* Current Eclipse release is Indigo Service Release 1.
** Available from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
** Use the J2EE for developers.
* For Maven integration add the Sonatype to the installation sites: http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e/
