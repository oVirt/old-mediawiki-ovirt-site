<code>MockEJBStrategyRule</code> is JUnit <code>@Rule</code> that handles mocking of the beans and resources managed by the EjbUtils class. 
Specifically, it seamlessly handles mocking transaction management, which is a common usecase in many bll tests.

= Creating the Rule =
Like with any <code>@Rule</code>, the only thing you need to do in order to incorporate it in your test class is to declare a public member annotated with <code>@Rule</code>:

<pre>
@Rule
public MockEJBStrategyRule ejbRule = new MockEJBStrategyRule();
</pre>

This declaration will mock EjbUtils' internal strategy, and handle mocking away transaction management.

= Mocking Additional Beans =
Transaction management is fine and well, but sometimes our tests will require additional behaviour defined for other beans.
This can be achieved by passing a map from <code>BeanType</code> to the implementing mock.
A simplified, single-line constructor, is also available for mocking an additional single bean
<pre>
@Rule
public MockEJBStrategyRule ejbRule = new MockEJBStrategyRule(BeanType.SCHEDULER, mySchedulerMock);
</pre>
