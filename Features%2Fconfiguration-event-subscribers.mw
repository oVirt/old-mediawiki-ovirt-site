=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Allows ovirt-engine-notifier users to subscribe to events using configuration.

=== Detailed Description ===
A new 'Event Filter' section is now available in the notifier's configuration file under<br/>
/share/ovirt-engine/services/ovirt-engine-notifier/ovirt-engine-notifier.conf <br />
(It's advisable to leave that file as is and define override file[s] under etc/ovirt-engine/notifier/notifier.conf.d/)<br/>
Lets take a look;

 #--------------#
 # Event Filter #
 #--------------#
 
 # Filter logic.
 #
 # First match algorithm for include/exclude messages.
 # Entry is message|*(subscriber|*)
 # * = all messages/all subscribers.
 # * as a subscriber should be used only for exclude.
 #
 # examples:
 # FILTER="include:VDC_START(smtp:mail@example.com) ${FILTER}"
 # FILTER="exclude:VDC_START include:*(smtp:mail1@gmail.com) ${FILTER}"
 #
 # The final filter list contains FILTER  as well as 'event_subscriber' table records.
 # database record are considered first.
 FILTER="exclude:*"

=== DB v.s Configuration ===

The final Filter is read uniformly from the both the database (available in web admin) and configuration.
DB records are of higher precedence and they are all of the include kind.

There are a few things to note:
* While the UI only permits subscription to a subset of selected events the configuration enables subscription to them all.
* While UI/DB subscribers subscribe to "event_up_name" events and get notifications on their matching  "event_down_name" according to the 'event_map' table, configuration subscribers need to register to each individual event to allow better granularity.
* There is a current limitation in the UI allowing only email subscription. this might change in the future.
The event_map as well as the complete event list is found in the following section.
