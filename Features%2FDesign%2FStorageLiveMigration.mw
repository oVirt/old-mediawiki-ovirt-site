=Storage Live Migration=
Live block migration is the operation in charge of moving a running VM and its disks from one storage domain to another.

==GUI==
No major gui modifications are required. The action to move a VM from one storage to another should be enabled also when the VM is running, in which case the engine will issue a live block migration.

==Pre-Copy, Post-Copy and Mirrored-Snapshot==
* '''Pre-Copy:''' copy all the internal volumes and then live copy the leaf volume, when the task is completed live migrate the VM
** '''Pros:''' safer and simpler to manage in the oVirt engine and VDSM
** '''Cons:''' if the snapshots are no longer needed then a lot of data is copied needlessly.  NB. Not implemented upstream yet
* '''Post-Copy:''' live migrate the VM with a live snapshot to the new domain, copy the internal volumes and when the task is completed switch the leaf backing file
** '''Pros:''' better approach for HA/load balancing
** '''Cons:''' complex management in the oVirt engine and VDSM.  Disk is split across multiple domains
* '''Mirrored-Snapshot:''' mirror a new live snapshot on both source and destination, copy the parent volume to the destination and when completed switch to the new image.
** '''Pros:''' no need to implement cross-domain volume chains in VDSM

==Post-Copy Execution Diagrams and Description==

* '''Note on [3]''': when the SPM finishes the operation it's also responsible to set the 'Snapshot 2 Volume' metadata to point to 'Snapshot 1 Volume' on 'Source Domain' even if the real swap happens in the next step.

===Limitations and Risks===
* VDSM doesn't have the proper metadata to describe a VM running on volumes stored on two different storage domains
* missing libvirt operation to change the volume backing file on the fly, new design and patches:
