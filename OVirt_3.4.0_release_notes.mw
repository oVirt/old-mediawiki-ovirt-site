{{DISPLAYTITLE:oVirt 3.4.0 release notes}}
The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of its fifth formal release, oVirt 3.4. 

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.

To find out more about features that were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the [[oVirt 3.3.2 release notes]], [[oVirt 3.3.1 release notes]], [[oVirt 3.3 release notes]], [[oVirt 3.2 release notes]], and [[oVirt 3.1 release notes]].
For a general overview of oVirt, read [[oVirt 3.0 Feature Guide | the oVirt 3.0 feature guide]] and the [[about oVirt]] page.

= Install / Upgrade from previous versions=
oVirt 3.4.0 release is now available!

In order to install it, you need to update ovirt-release to 10.0.1 or newer by running
 # yum update ovirt-release

If above doesn't work for you, try using distribution specific name:

CentOS:
 # yum update ovirt-release-el6
Fedora:
 # yum update ovirt-release-fedora

* '''Note''' that on CentOS and RHEL you'll need also [http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm EPEL] repositories enabled.
* '''Note''' that on CentOS and RHEL for DWH you'll need also [http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/jpackage/6.0/generic/free/RPMS/jpackage-release-6-3.jpp6.noarch.rpm jpackage 6] repositories enabled.
* '''Note''' that on Fedora 19 you'll need to enable fedora-updates repository for having updated openstack packages (was in fedora-updates-testing until Jan 23th - you might want to run 'yum clean all').
* '''Note''' that on Fedora 19 you'll need to enable fedora-virt-preview repository for using Fedora 19 as node on 3.4 clusters.

and then enable ovirt-3.4.0-prerelease repository

for CentOS / RHEL:
 [ovirt-3.4.0-prerelease]
 name=Pre release builds of the oVirt 3.4 project
 baseurl=http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/3.4.0_pre/rpm/EL/$releasever/
 enabled=1
 skip_if_unavailable=1
 gpgcheck=0

for Fedora:
 [ovirt-3.4.0-prerelease]
 name=Pre release builds of the oVirt 3.4 project
 baseurl=http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/3.4.0_pre/rpm/Fedora/$releasever/
 enabled=1
 skip_if_unavailable=1
 gpgcheck=0

== Fedora / CentOS / RHEL ==

If you're installing oVirt 3.4.0 release candidate on a clean host, you should read our [[Quick Start Guide]]

If you're using nightly repo you'll need to run:
  # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
  # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.3 you should just execute:
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
 # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.2 you should read [[oVirt 3.2 to 3.3 upgrade]]

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.1 you should upgrade to 3.2 before upgrading to 3.3.1.
Please read [[oVirt 3.1 to 3.2 upgrade]] before starting the upgrade.<br>
On CentOS and RHEL:
For upgrading to 3.2 you'll need 3.2 stable repository.<br>
So, first step is disable 3.3 / stable repository and enable 3.2 in /etc/yum.repos.d/ovirt.repo:

 [ovirt-32]
 name=Stable builds of the oVirt 3.2 project
 baseurl=http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/3.2/rpm/EL/$releasever/
 enabled=1
 skip_if_unavailable=1
 gpgcheck=0

Then
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
should install  ovirt-engine-setup-3.2.3-1.el6.noarch.rpm<br>
if you have already updated to 3.3.x please use distro-sync or downgrade instead of update.<br>
Then:
 # engine-upgrade
this will upgrade your system to latest 3.2.<br>
Once you've all working on 3.2, enable 3.3/stable repository, then just
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
 # engine-setup
will upgrade to latest 3.3.

= What's New in 3.4.0? =
* ovirt-engine-reports, ovirt-engine-dwh
** integrated to ovirt-engine setup.
** Gentoo support.

== Node ==

oVirt Node for oVirt 3.4 can be found at http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/3.4.0_pre/iso/ .

There are no big known issues with it, if you run into issue please try Node in permissive mode by appending <code>enforcing=0</code> to the kernel cmdline.

=Known issues=

* EL >= 6.5 or cloud-init >= 0.7.2 are needed for cloud-init feature support ({{BZ|1029885}})
* all-in-one  requires fedora-virt-preview repo as in the next item
* For using Fedora 19 as node on 3.4 clusters you need to enable fedora-virt-preview repository ({{BZ|1056918}})
* Node
** Needs to be booted in permissive mode by appending: enforcing=0
* Fedora 20 does not work as an engine ({{BZ|1060198}})
* engine-setup: upgrade from 3.3 overwrites exports with acl None ({{BZ|1058018}})
* Hosts with Fedora19 might not be able to discover iscsi targets due ({{BZ|1057761}}), it's recommended to update selinux and selinux-target packages to version [https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/selinux-policy-3.12.1-74.19.fc19 3.12.1-74.19]
* Host deployment may fail on EL6 system due to a recent tuned regression ({{BZ|1069119}}, {{BZ|1069245}}). Please downgrade tuned to previous version while waiting for a new tuned package solving this issue.
