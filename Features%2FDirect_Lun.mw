== Introduction ==

Any block device can be used as local disk in the VM specifying it's GUID or UUID.

== Engine / VDSM API ==

A new API is added for this feature.

The API specifies a block device by GUID or UUID, instead of the PDIV quartet of a regular [[Live_Snapshots#Introduction|VDSM volume]].

See [[Features/Design/StableDeviceAddresses]] for the complete interface.
