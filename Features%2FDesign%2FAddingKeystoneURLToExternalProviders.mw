Currently,  all OpenStack external providers like Neutron and Glance are using the same Keystone authentication URL stored in the KeystoneAuthUrl configuration value.
The requirement is to add a URL field per such provider for setting that URL and enable diffrent OpenStack providers using diffrent Keystone authentication URLs

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
In order to support multiple OpenStack external providers that use different Keystone URLs we should:

  * Add a auth_url field to the providers table
  * Add a new Authentication URL field to the New/Edit External Provider dialog under the Requires Authentication 
     checkbox, this field will be visible only for OpenStack providers.
  * Change code to take provider's Keystone URL from the auth_url column in he providers table rather than
     from the configuration KeystoneAuthUrl value
  * Provide upgrade script that populates auth_url for OpenStack external providers that have auth_required set
     to true from  the configuration KeystoneAuthUrl value
  * Remove configuration KeystoneAuthUrl key from  vdc_options 
  * Remove KeystoneAuthUrl from engine-config
