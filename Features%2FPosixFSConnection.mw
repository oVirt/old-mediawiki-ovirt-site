Also known as SharedFS support

== Summery ==
Will allow VDSM to use any mountable target a a domain.

== Current Status ==
Done:
* Make needed changes in VDSM (http://gerrit.ovirt.org/559)
To do:
* Make needed change in Ovirt-Engine
* Make needed change in the GUIs
== Description ==
Currently VDSM only supports using NFS as a remote domain target. This feature will allow VDSM to use any mountable target that adheres to posix file semantics to be used in VDSM as a domain.

This will not replace specialized support but rather compliment. The underlying implementation will only adhere to posix semantics and will ignore quirks and hacks needed by any random target. This is why it is highly recommended to use a the specialized domain types when available.

== Dependency ==
None

== Related Features ==
[[Features/ConnectionMonitoring]]

== Affected Functionality ==
* storage domain creation\connection\removal - It is now possible to specify a new connection type

== User Experience ==
User should be able to witness the wonders of this new functionality

== Upgrade ==
Just works!

== User work flows ==
User will be able to connect to said target and enter specialized parameters.
