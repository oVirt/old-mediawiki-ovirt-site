$REPOURL is any of the URLs listed in the [[Feature/GuestAgentDebian#Repository|Repository]] section
 # echo "deb $REPOURL ./" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
 # gpg -v -a --keyserver $REPOURL/Release.key --recv-keys D5C7F7C373A1A299
 # gpg --export --armor 73A1A299 | apt-key add -

=== Testing ===
<!-- Explain how this feature may be tested by a user or a quality engineer. List relevant use cases and expected results. -->
Testing has to be executed on a Ubuntu 12.04+ system. Lower versions do not fulfil the minimal requirements for the guest agent.

==== Verification ====
* Follow the installation instructions above to install the guest agent
* After about 15-30 seconds the Web Admin Portal entry for the VM should show:
** the IPv4 Addresses of the VM  in the grid
** the FQDN of the VM in the grid
** kernel package and the ovirt-guest-agent-common package in the application list
** The FQDN in the general tab
** Logged-in User: in the Sessions tab should be filled if a user is logged in.
** All IPs (IPv4 and IPv6) in the Network Interfaces tab in the Guest Agent Data section for each interface. 
* Verification via on the VDSM side: `vdsClient -s 0 getVmStats <VM UUID>`
** Reported fields are non-empty:
*** guestFQDN
*** netIfaces
*** disksUsage
*** memoryStats
*** guestName
*** appsList
*** guestOs
*** username
*** guestIPs (if there are IPv4 addresses)

'''Note:''' The VM UUID can be found on the Admin Portal in the General tab for the VM
'''Note:''' The FQDN value is only only shown if the FQDN is not empty, not localhost and not localhost.localdomain
