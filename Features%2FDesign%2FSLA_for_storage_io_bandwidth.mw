==Introduction==
This wiki page focuses on the design of storage resources  Service Level Agreement(SLA).   Existing iotune properties(quota) are applied on a vDisk of VM, and provides the ability to provide additional per-device I/O tuning. They include the following elements:
*total_bytes_sec
**The optional total_bytes_sec element is the total throughput limit in bytes per second. This cannot appear with read_bytes_sec or write_bytes_sec.
*read_bytes_sec
**The optional read_bytes_sec element is the read throughput limit in bytes per second.
*write_bytes_sec
**The optional write_bytes_sec element is the write throughput limit in bytes per second.
*total_iops_sec
**The optional total_iops_sec element is the total I/O operations per second. This cannot appear with read_iops_sec or write_iops_sec.
*read_iops_sec
**The optional read_iops_sec element is the read I/O operations per second.
*write_iops_sec
**The optional write_iops_sec element is the write I/O operations per second.
Any sub-element not specified or given with a value of 0 implies no limit.

===Basic functionality===
Users can set the elements for a specific vDisk when a VM is created or running. These elements are kept in migration.
This requires support of this in VDSM API: create VM, hot plug and update VM device. Dynamic setting these elements should also be supported.

===Automatic per-device I/O tuning===
In VDSM, each storage domain backend only provides limited IO bandwidth capability. If bandwidth become scarce resource, the efficiency of vm  IO operations will be affected by other vms. This is not the situation we want, and therefore we need to limit the bandwidth usage to allocate the bandwidth in a better way. 

Volumes in backend storage of a storage domain are used by plenty of vms as vDisks, and thus a vm's vDisk bandwidth should be limited by a quota according to the capability of this backend storage.  In the following chapters, we will explain how to tune the quota dynamically . The quota adjustment is performed by MOM and VDSM. 

This section gives the  way to set initial value. This value is used as start point when quota is adjusted. The quota is then tuned according to IO bandwidth usage and capability of backend storage bandwidth. During this tuning procedure, the quota can not be inflated or deflated arbitrarily, so we constrain it in a dynamic calculated range.   

====Initial quota value====
The initial quota of vDisks bandwidth can be set to the value when vm is created, dynamically set via VDSM API or bandwidth capability of the related backend storage. The capability is estimated based on physical backend IO bandwidth capability or detected in some other way. 

====Quota tuning====
Quota is tuned by a similar mechanism in MOM. MOM collects bandwidth capability information and IO bandwidth usage statistics of backend storages and related volumes. According to this information and related policy, the policy engine decides how to tune the quota of vDisk which uses that backend storage . 

If the backend storage bandwidth is heavily used(i.e. The unused bandwidth ratio of that backend is lower than a threshold), the quotas for the vDisks related to that backend are deflated by a certain percent. Otherwise, the quotas for the vDisks bandwidth are inflated by the same percent.

At the same time, the policy make sure that the quota is in a proper range dynamically calculated. The policy calculated the range for different priority level vDisks in diverse ways. The vDisk is either high priority or low priority, and the level may derived from the priority of user/vm. For high priority vDisks, the policy tends to make the lower bound of range not too small. In the opposite, the policy tends to make the upper bound of range not too large for low priority vDisks. The details is described as following:

* inflate quota
  high priority vDisk: 
    min = used + cap * min_vDisk_unused_percent (e.g. 0.2)
    max = cap
  low priority vDisk: 
    min = used
    max = used + cap * min_vDisk_unused_percent(e.g. 0.2)
    used means the used bandwidth of that vDisk. 
    cap is short for capability of backend storage for the storage domain.

* deflate quota
  high priority vDisk: 
    min =  used + cur * vDisk_unused_percent 
    vDisk_unused_percent = backend_unused_percent -0.05 ( if bandwidth is quite scarce )
    vDisk_unused_percent= backend_unused_percent* min_vDisk_unused_percent(e.g. 0.2)/ threshold(e.g. 0.2) (if bandwidth is not quite scarce but below threshold)
    max = cap
  low priority vDisk: 
    min = used
    max = used + cur * vDisk_unused_percent 
    cur means the current quota value
