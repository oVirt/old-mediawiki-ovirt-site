=== Summary ===
New verb <code>getRoute</code> should return name of a device assigned to given IP address.

== Detailed Description ==
During deployment of a new host, Engine needs to know which of the host's interfaces is used to connect to Engine. Currently, this is exposed by the `lastClientIface` element of `getVdsCaps` verb. However, this approach is problematic, as we plant to remove the requirement of direct Engine-Vdsm TCP connection, without which, Vdsm cannot compute this element.

Instead, it is suggested that Vdsm would expose the output of `ip route get <addr>`, so that Engine would be able to guess which on top of which host should it configure the management network. Note that this would only be a guess, as Vdsm may sit behind NAT with no route to Engine. In that case, automatic deployment of the management network would be skipped.

== Engine ==
During "Add Host" flow, Engine defines the management network on the added host. It decides which interface should be used for that network based on the <code>lastClientIface</code> element. <code>lastClientIface</code> is to deprecated, so Engine should use the new verb when for clusterLevel>3.6

== VDSM ==
To implement this new verb we could use <code>netinfo.getRouteDeviceTo(ip_address)</code> function, which uses <code>ipwrapper</code> to do route handling.
