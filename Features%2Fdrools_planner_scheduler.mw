== Drools scheduler ==

=== Summary ===

To improve the quality of VM scheduling, built on the plugable scheduling architecture, this project will integrate drools and planner into the ovirt engine

=== Detailed Description ===

==== Overview ====

[[File:Drools_score_calculation_plan.png]]

The rule calculation will be broken down to three major categories:
* costs of the migration
* benefits of the migration
* costs of the situatuion

Also, there will be some hard constraints enforced, e.g. required optional networks must be available on vds.

==== Costs of the migration ====

Migration costs will be calculated in order to prevent migrating VM's for minor/momentary benefits.

As part of the migration, these costs should be calculated:
* The size of the allocated memory of the VM, this data must be sent over the network, so the more data, the slower
* The actual CPU load, since at migration the throughput drops to zero for a short time, but users do not tolerate such delays.
* Is console attached. If VM is in use by user, it may be better to migrate another Vm from the host.


==== costs of the situation ====

The costs of the situation are calculated in order to counterweight the costs of the migration. Some example for situation costs:
* Overallocation of CPU/memory/network bandwidth/IO
* High utilisation of physical CPU/memory/network bandwidth/IO
* Unused resources CPU/memory/network bandwidth/IO - since they only consume power. e.g. a server with 16 CPU's with only 2 vcpus allocated.

The overallocation should be a smaller cost, while the high utilisation should generate a bigger one, but only when it happens.

==== Benefits of the migration ====

The benefits of the migration:
* may help to counterweight the costs of the migration
* help to select the optimal available host

Also the benefits may be negative, in case the host is already overallocated or overused.
