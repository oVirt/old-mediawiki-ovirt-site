== iSCSI MultiPath ==

{{Feature|name=iSCSI Multipath|modules=storage|version=3.4|status=Released}}

=== Summary ===

iSCSI multipath feature enables the user to configure the iSCSI multipath from oVirt, by specifying specific networks to be used by the multipath
with that configuration the user can configure the Hosts to connect to the iSCSI server through this specific networks.

===  A brief about multipath linux  ===
[[Feature/iSCSI-Multipath#Device-Mapper|Device-Mapper]] Multipath (DM-Multipath) is a Linux native multipath tool, which allows to [[Feature/iSCSI-Multipath#Configuration of Multipath|configure]] multiple I/O paths between server nodes and storage arrays into a single device.<BR/>
Each multipath device has a World Wide Identifier (WWID), which is guaranteed to be globally unique and unchanging. By default, the name of a multipath device is set to its WWID<BR/><BR/>

===== Configuration of Multipath =====
The configuration of the multipath service  is being done on each host and it is the user responsibility to configure it at multipath.conf<BR/>
Some of the attributes being configured among many others are 
* path_selector algorithm which determines which path  to use for every I/O operation to the storage (round-robin, queue length, service time)
* path_grouping_policy  - failover, multibus, group by
* checker_timeout  - The timeout to use for path checkers that issue SCSI commands with an explicit timeout, in seconds. The default value is taken from sys/block/sdx/device/timeout


===== Device-Mapper =====
The Device-Mapper is a Linux kernel framework which used for mapping block devices onto higher-level virtual block devices.
In the Linux kernel, the device-mapper is a generic framework to map one block device into another.
Device mapper works by passing data from a virtual block device (provided by the device mapper itself) to another block device.

=== Detailed Description ===
The iSCSI multipath Bond is an entity managed under the Data Center.<BR/>
Once the Data Center has iSCSI storage attached to it, the user can configure an iSCSI bond with an appropriate networks.<BR/>
The User choose which networks the iSCSI multipath Bond will be assembled from.<BR/>
The iSCSI bond can be empty, with no networks configured in it, or it can be configured with one or more networks related to the Data Center.<BR/>
<BR/>
Once the iSCSI multipath is configured with networks all the Hosts in the Data Center will connect to the iSCSI Storage Domain through this iSCSI bond the user configured.<BR/>
The path selection for the connection to the iSCSI storage will be configured by the multipath.conf in each host.<BR/><BR/>

=== Permissions ===
Every user with permissions on the Data Center, can add/change or remove iSCSI Bond.

=== Limitations ===
* Each Data Center can have multiple iSCSI Bonds
* Once a network is being removed from a Data Ceneter it should automatically be reomve from the iSCSI Bond
* iSCSI Bond name should be unique on each Data Center

=== User Experience ===
For the user to start using the iSCSI bond, it will need to do the following:

# Add an iSCSI Storage to the Data Center
#  Make sure the Data Center contains networks.
#  Go to the Data Center main tab and choose the specific Data Center
#  At the sub tab choose "iSCSI Bond"
#  Press the "new" button to add a new iSCSI Bond
#  Configure the networks you want to add to the new iSCSI Bond.

Once a new iSCSI bond is configured, The Hosts in the Data Center connects to the iSCSI storage using the networks configured in the bond.
