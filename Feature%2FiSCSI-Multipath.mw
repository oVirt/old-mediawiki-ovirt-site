with that configuration the user can configure the Hosts to connect to the iSCSI server through this specific networks.

====  A brief regarding multipath linux  ====
 (see [[Features//iSCSI-Multipath#Device-Mapper|Device-Mapper]].) Multipath (DM-Multipath) is a Linux native multipath tool, which allows you to configure multiple I/O paths between server nodes and storage arrays into a single device.<BR/>
Each multipath device has a World Wide Identifier (WWID), which is guaranteed to be globally unique and unchanging. By default, the name of a multipath device is set to its WWID<BR/><BR/>

===== Device-Mapper =====
The Device-Mapper is a Linux kernel framework which used for mapping block devices onto higher-level virtual block devices.
In the Linux kernel, the device-mapper is a generic framework to map one block device into another.
Device mapper works by passing data from a virtual block device (provided by the device mapper itself) to another block device.
