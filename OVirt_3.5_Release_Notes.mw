{{DISPLAYTITLE:oVirt 3.5 Release Notes}}

The oVirt development team is pleased to announce oVirt 3.5.0 RC release availability as of Aug 5th 2014.
oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an excellent KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the  [[oVirt 3.4.1 release notes]],  [[oVirt 3.3.5 release notes]], [[oVirt 3.2 release notes]] and [[oVirt 3.1 release notes]].
For a general overview of oVirt, read [[oVirt 3.0 Feature Guide | the oVirt 3.0 feature guide]] and the [[about oVirt]] page.

= oVirt 3.5.0 RELEASE CANDIDATE Release Notes =

== RELEASE CANDIDATE ==
The oVirt Project is working on oVirt 3.5.0 release candidate. To install this release, you must enable the oVirt 3.5 pre-release repository.
See the below section on Install / Upgrade for detailed instructions.

== Known Issues ==
* If you are using a Fedora 19 host, you require libvirt >= 1.0.1 to use cluster level 3.5.
* (pkg will be provided from ovirt repo, but if it not there, you can update from a Fedora 20 repo: :  yum update --releasever=20 libvirt\* )
* If you cannot refresh an ISO file list after adding a host, see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1114499 for a workaround.
* Upgrading from 3.5 alpha can fail due to the structure of a table being different in 3.5 alpha to that in 3.5 beta1 and later (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1114967).
* Users that use DWH and Reports from 3.5 firts beta will need to run # yum distro-sync "ovirt-engine-dwh*" "ovirt-engine-reports*" due to bad rpm release number  for DWH and reports packages.
* {{BZ|1124099}} - Live Merge: Limit merge operations based on hosts' capabilities
* ovirt-optimizer has not been updated for EL6 due to dependencies issues
* vdsm for EL7 is missing a couple of patches compared to other distro due to building issues

==Feature #1==
<description>

==Other Enhancements==
=== Virt ===

=== Infra ===

==== Extensions manager and mechanism ====

An API for providing  engine extensions for the following was introduced in oVirt 3.5:
 * AAA
 * Log

To develop an extension, you must use the classes and interfaces defined via the ovirt-engine-extensions-API and pack the extension as a jboss module.

==== AAA refactor ====
The engine was refactored to use the API mentioned above - the existing implmenetations were packed as "built-in" jboss modules.
A speration between authorization and authentication was introrduced at the code.
The session management mechanism at engine was changed to rely on engine session Id.
In addition,  the authentication flows for  the web applications (REST-API and GUI)  were refactored using a set of servlet filters that can be reused for various web applications.

==== JSON Remote Procedure Call ====
JSON remote procedure call over stomp was added to the communication layer between the engine and VDSM. This new protocol is designed to be simple, require less parsing than the currently implemented XML remote procedure calls, and introduces asynchronous communication. VDSM binds to a single port and can detect which protocol is used when a connection is established, delegating connection handling to the JSON remote procedure call or XML remote procedure call layer.

==== Advanced Foreman Integration ====
Integration of Foreman with oVirt provides the ability to add hypervisor hosts managed by Foreman to oVirt engine (installed hosts and discovered hosts). The feature includes user interface changes for providing a list of discovered hosts in the addHost popup view, with information on hardware, host groups and compute resources. On the Foreman side, oVirt provides a new Foreman plug-in (https://github.com/theforeman/ovirt_provision_plugin) that automatically performs the deployment process after host is provisioned. For more information, see http://www.ovirt.org/Features/AdvancedForemanIntegration.

=== Generic LDAP Provider ===
The generic LDAP provider is based on the extensions API as described above.
The provider uses configuration files that provide the required information for authentication and authorization, including LDAP vendor specific information, in the case of authorization provider based on LDAP.
The configuration files can be found at :
/etc/ovirt-engine/extensions.d

=== Networking ===
==== Unified persistence ====
Unified persistence is a way for oVirt-defined network configurations in hosts to be set in a format that is distribution agnostic and that closely matches the oVirt network setup API. When configuring an oVirt network on a host, it will now create a file for the network definition in:
/var/run/vdsm/netconf/nets
and another one for the bonding definition, if the network uses a bond, in:
/var/run/vdsm/netconf/bonds

These files are in written in the quite human readable JSON format. However, they should not be manually edited because they are automatically generated and not read on change. '''Networking changes and customizations should always be performed through the API'''.

When the network configuration is saved via the oVirt API, these network and bond definition files will be snapshotted to the following locations:
/var/lib/vdsm/persistence/netconf/nets
/var/lib/vdsm/persistence/netconf/bonds

It would be possible to alter the network definitions there and when rebooting the machine have the changes applied. That, however, would mean that the host network is not synchronized with the oVirt engine network definition and this method is strongly discouraged and unsupported.

While oVirt networking "unified persistence" has been available for a while, it was always disabled by default. With 3.5, it is made the default way of persisting networks in the hosts.

===== What does this change mean for the admin? =====

It means that any change done to the ifcfg files that have been created by vdsm will be ephemeral and will be lost the next time vdsmd restores its network configurations from the new file definitions (this typically happens at boot time but can be forced by doing "vdsm-tool restore-nets"). Thus, it is of utmost importance that '''if you have ifcfg handmade customizations that you port those changes to be use custom network properties and write a hook to apply them'''.

If you have any manually created ifcfg file that should not be deleted by vdsm network restoring you should make sure that it does not have a header like:
    # Generated by VDSM version 4.14.1-261.git4d9954e.el6
Otherwise the ifcfg file will be removed at the next network restoration event.

Finally, it is important to note that with the advent of this change, '''any oVirt defined network will only be configured at boot if the vdsmd is enabled,''' as vdsm is the network configuration agent for these networks. For the final release a special case will be made for the management network, so that it starts even when vdsmd is disabled. However, it is advised to handle with care vdsm disabling and restart, as '''a host with vdsmd disabled and no non-vdsm networks would not have any network connectivity'''.

===== What advantage does it bring? =====

Having unified persistence enabled means that from now on, one can switch the network configurator to iproute2 (which is still disabled by default) and enjoy the same network experience in a much faster, cross-distribution agnostic way. This is not just important for the debian/ubuntu port, but also makes porting to new distributions easier and highlights the importance of using the Hooks and Custom network properties API for your customization needs.

===== What to do if I don't want to deal with this =====

If the admin decides to postpone the move to unified persistence, it is possible to go back to the deprecated "ifcfg" persistence by editing /etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf and setting:
    net_persistence=ifcfg
Note that some new '''features in upcoming releases may very well be unavailable for the deprecated "ifcfg" persistence mode'''.

==== Neutron Virtual Appliance ====
A Neutron Virtual Appliance will be available from the oVirt Image Repository (glance.ovirt.org). For 3.5 the appliance is based on OpenStack IceHouse, listed as ""Neutron Appliance (CentOS X.X) - IceHouse-YYYY.X-XX" on the provided images list.<br>
The appliance reduces the need of a user to provide an installed and pre-configured keystone and neutron servers. Instead, the user can use the provided one, which is already configured with ml2 as the core plugin, openvSwitch as the mechanism driver and vlans.

=== Storage ===

=== SLA & Scheduling ===

=== UX Enhancements ===

=== Hosted Engine ===
* Added support for VLAN-tagged network interfaces
* Added support for bonded network interfaces
* Added support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (or similar)

= Install / Upgrade from previous versions=

== RELEASE CANDIDATE ==
The oVirt Project is working on oVirt 3.5.0 release candidate. In order to install it you've to enable oVirt 3.5 pre release repository.

'''Please note that mirror may take a couple of days in order to be updated'''

You can disable mirrors and use ovirt repository by commenting the mirrorlist line and removing comment on baseurl line in '''/etc/yum.repos.d/ovirt-3.5.repo'''

== Fedora / CentOS / RHEL ==
In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install 
 # yum localinstall http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release35.rpm
You should read then our [[Quick Start Guide]]

Please note that this is still a development release; installation on a production system is not recommended.

If you are upgrading from a previous version, you should have the ovirt-release package already installed on your system.
You can then install ovirt-release35.rpm as in a clean install side-by-side.

If you are upgrading from oVirt 3.4.0, you can now remove the ovirt-release package:
 # yum remove ovirt-release
 # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
 # engine-setup

If you are upgrading from oVirt  < 3.4.0, you must first upgrade to oVirt 3.4.1.
Please see [[oVirt 3.4.1 release notes]] for upgrade instructions.

=== Networking ===
See the [[OVirt_3.5_Release_Notes#Networking|networking features]] above for an explanation of the important networking change that oVirt 3.5 introduces for the hypervisor hosts (not for the engine ones).

On the vdsmd restart that happens when upgrading VDSM to the oVirt 3.5 release, VDSM will take a memory snapshot of the oVirt-defined networks and convert them to the unified persistence format. From then on, running vdsm-tool restore-nets or rebooting the machine will only use the new "unified persistence" definitions and any ifcfg file that was generated by VDSM will be removed by the VDSM network restoration events.

== oVirt Node ==

a fresh oVirt Node build is also available now:
 # http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.5-pre/iso/ovirt-node-iso-3.5.0.ovirt35.20140630.el6.iso
* To circumvent some SELinux issues, please append enforcing=0 to the kernel commandline when booting the ISO.
* The ISO is missing the plugin for Hosted Engine, but we hope to deliver an iso which includes this plugin shortly.

== oVirt Live ==

A new oVirt Live ISO is available: (no update since the alpha, might be released seperatelly) 
 http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.5-pre/iso/ovirt-live-el6-3.5.0-alpha2.iso

== oVirt Windows Guest Tools ==
The first candidate release of oVirt 3.5 WGT is available:
   http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.5-pre/iso/ovirt-guest-tools/ovirt-guest-tools-3.5_5.iso
It currently includes the installer for all VirtIO-Win drivers (Serial, Balloon, Net, Block and SCSI), Spice QXL and Agent as well as oVirt Guest Agent, as well as the binaries that went into the installer. 
Support for Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 was added.
Note that if you have a previously installed version of oVirt WGT, then you need to uninstall it before installing this version.

The installer itself can be downloaded from:
   http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.5-pre/iso/ovirt-guest-tools/ovirt-guest-tools-3.5_5.exe

More information can be found in the [[Features/oVirt_Windows_Guest_Tools|oVirt Windows Guest Tools]] feature page.
