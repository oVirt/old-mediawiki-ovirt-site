== ALPHA RELEASE ==
oVirt 3.5.0 Alpha release is available since 2014-05-16. In order to install it you've to enable oVirt 3.5 pre release repository.

In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install 
 # yum localinstall http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release35.rpm
You should read then our [[Quick Start Guide]]

Please note that this is still a development release, installation on a production system is not recommended.

If you're upgrading from a previous version you should have ovirt-release package already installed on your system.
You can then install ovirt-release35.rpm as in a clean install side-by-side.

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.4.0 you can now remove ovirt-release package:
 # yum remove ovirt-release
 # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
 # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt  < 3.4.0 you must first upgrade to oVirt 3.4.1.
Please see [[oVirt 3.4.1 release notes]] for upgrading instructions.
