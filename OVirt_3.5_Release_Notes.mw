{{DISPLAYTITLE:oVirt 3.5 Release Notes}}

DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT

The oVirt development team is pleased to announce oVirt 3.5.0 Alpha release availability as of May 20th 2014.
oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an excellent KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the  [[oVirt 3.4.1 release notes]],  [[oVirt 3.3.5 release notes]], [[oVirt 3.2 release notes]] and [[oVirt 3.1 release notes]].
For a general overview of oVirt, read [[oVirt 3.0 Feature Guide | the oVirt 3.0 feature guide]] and the [[about oVirt]] page.

= oVirt 3.5.0 ALPHA Release Notes =

== ALPHA RELEASE ==
The oVirt Project is working on oVirt 3.5.0 Alpha release. In order to install it you've to enable oVirt 3.5 pre release repository.
See below section on Install / Upgrade for having detailed instructions.

= Known Issues =
* VDSM packages released with the first 3.5.0 alpha have version lower than the ones we had in 3.4.1 so they won't be updated.
* You can't add hosts to 3.5 clusters until a new VDSM build with 3.5 compatibility level will be released (All in One won't work).

==Feature #1==
<description>

==Other Enhancements==
=== Virt ===

=== Infra ===

=== Networking ===
==== Unified persistence ====
Unified persistence is a way for the oVirt defined network configurations in the hosts to be set in a format that is distribution agnostic and that closely matches the oVirt network setup API. When configuring an oVirt network on a host, it will now create a file for the network definition in:
    /var/run/vdsm/netconf/nets
and another one for the bonding definition, if the network uses a bond, in:
    /var/run/vdsm/netconf/bonds

These files are in written in the quite human readable JSON format. However, they should not be manually edited as they are automatically generated and not read on change. '''Networking changes and customizations should always be performed through the API'''.

When the network configuration is saved via the oVirt API, these network and bond definition files will be snapshotted to
    /var/lib/vdsm/persistence/netconf/nets
    /var/lib/vdsm/persistence/netconf/bonds

It would be possible to alter there the network definitions and when rebooting the machine having the changes applied. That, however, would mean that the host network is unsynched with the oVirt engine network definition and is strongly discouraged and unsupported.

While oVirt networking "unified persistence" has been available for a while, it was always disabled by default. With 3.5, it is made the default way of persisting networks in the hosts.

===== What does this change mean for the admin? =====

It means that any change done to the ifcfg files that have been created by vdsm will be ephemeral and will be lost the next time vdsmd restores its network configurations from the new file definitions (this typically happens at boot time but can be forced by doing "vdsm-tool restore-nets"). Thus, it is of utmost importance that '''if you have ifcfg handmade customizations that you port those changes to be use custom network properties and write a hook to apply them'''.

If you have any manually created ifcfg file that should not be deleted by vdsm network restoring you should make sure that it does not have a header like:
    # Generated by VDSM version 4.14.1-261.git4d9954e.el6
Otherwise the ifcfg file will be removed at the next network restoration event.

Finally, it is important to note that with the advent of this change, '''any oVirt defined network will only be configured at boot if the vdsmd is enabled,''' as vdsm is the network configuration agent for these networks. For the final release a special case will be made for the management network, so that it starts even when vdsmd is disabled. However, it is advised to handle with care vdsm disabling and restart, as '''a host with vdsmd disabled and no non-vdsm networks would not have any network connectivity'''.

===== What advantage does it bring? =====

Having unified persistence enabled means that from now on, one can switch the network configurator to iproute2 (which is still disabled by default) and enjoy the same network experience in a much faster, cross-distribution agnostic way. This is not just important for the debian/ubuntu port, but also makes porting to new distributions easier and highlights the importance of using the Hooks and Custom network properties API for your customization needs.

===== What to do if I don't want to deal with this =====

If the admin decides to postpone the move to unified persistence, it is possible to go back to the deprecated "ifcfg" persistence by editing /etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf and setting:
    net_persistence=ifcfg
Note that some new '''features in upcoming releases may very well be unavailable for the deprecated "ifcfg" persistence mode'''.

=== Storage ===

=== SLA & Scheduling ===

=== UX Enhancements ===

=== Hosted Engine ===
* Added support for VLAN-tagged network interfaces
* Added support for bonded network interfaces

= Install / Upgrade from previous versions=

== ALPHA RELEASE ==
The oVirt Project is working on oVirt 3.5.0 Alpha release. In order to install it you've to enable oVirt 3.5 pre release repository.

'''Please note that mirror may take a couple of days in order to be updated'''

You can disable mirrors and use ovirt repository by commenting the mirrorlist line and removing comment on baseurl line in '''/etc/yum.repos.d/ovirt-3.5.repo'''

== Fedora / CentOS / RHEL ==
In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install 
 # yum localinstall http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release35.rpm
You should read then our [[Quick Start Guide]]

Please note that this is still a development release, installation on a production system is not recommended.

If you're upgrading from a previous version you should have ovirt-release package already installed on your system.
You can then install ovirt-release35.rpm as in a clean install side-by-side.

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.4.0 you can now remove ovirt-release package:
 # yum remove ovirt-release
 # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
 # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt  < 3.4.0 you must first upgrade to oVirt 3.4.1.
Please see [[oVirt 3.4.1 release notes]] for upgrading instructions.

=== Networking ===
Please, see the [[OVirt_3.5_Release_Notes#Networking|networking features]] above for the explanation of the important networking change that 3.5 introduces for the hypervisor hosts (not for the engine ones).

On the vdsmd restart that happens when upgrading vdsm to the oVirt 3.5 release, vdsm will take a memory snapshot of the oVirt defined networks and convert them to the unified persistence format. From then on, doing vdsm-tool restore-nets or rebooting the machine will only use the new "unified persistence" definitions and any ifcfg file that was generated by vdsm will be removed by the vdsm network restoration events.

== oVirt Live ==

A new oVirt Live ISO is available:
