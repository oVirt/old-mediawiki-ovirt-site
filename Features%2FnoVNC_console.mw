= noVNC console in oVirt  =

== Summary ==
The aim of this feature is to make it possible to connect to VM consoles using
HTML 5 VNC client called "noVNC" in browsers supporting websockets and HTML5
postMessage function (webkit browsers, Firefox, IE > 10).

== Status ==
* Engine part of implementation (loading noVNC client and making it connect to websocket proxy using postMessage) - DONE
* Websockets proxy customization - DONE
* Security over TLS - DONE

== Benefit to oVirt ==
* enhancing the possibilities of connecting to the console in oVirt
* there is no need for userns to have native VNC client installed when using noVNC

== Details ==
The noVNC client utilizes websockets for passing VNC data. However, VNC server
in qemu doesn't support websockets natively and there must be a websocket proxy 
placed between the client and VNC server.
This proxy can run either on any node that has access to the host network, or
it can run on each host.

 (Note: There is a patch that integrates websockets directly to qemu, but it  will not be merged into DS at the time we need it to be there. As soon as it's  merged, we should switch to using this  feature instead of standalone websockets server).

The noVNC client is a html5 page with javascript which talks to websocket
server (e.g. python-websockify). This page is served by engine itself.

Upon establishing the VNC session, the noVNC client (HTML + js) must know where
to connect.  For passing such information, the HTML5 window.postMessage
function can be used. As soon as the client receives the information, 
it connects to websockets proxy which runs on a particular host:port. 
Now the VNC information (vnc host:port, ticket) must be passed to the proxy to
know where to connect. This information is passed via url path.

The websockets proxy reads data from the path and establishes connection to
the VNC server.

== noVNC client and python-websockify customization ==
There are two changes that must be made to noVNC client and websockify.
=== noVNC client changes ===
For our purposes, the noVNC client html page must listen to VNC information
passed from the engine using HTML5 postMessage. This requires adding 
event listener "message" to the page. The handler receives information
required for establishing VNC connection via websockets and passes it
to websockets proxy. This information is:
* vnc host:port
* vnc password (ticket)
Additional information that client has to know is:
* websocket proxy host:port (passed via parameters in url)
The implementation modifies vnc_auto.html page that comes from noVNC client.

=== websockify changes ===
The implementation is based on nova-novnc proxy which reads a token from
a cookie, makes an rpc call to the nova consoleauth node and retrieves
all connection information (which is connected to this token).

In VDSM we have no such thing as nova token. We must pass all the connection
info somehow. In the initial implementation it was passed via a cookie. However
the new implementation passes it using url path. 

After the proxy receives the data, it establishes the vnc connection.

== Location of the websockets server ==

There are three possible places where the websocket server can run:
# On the machine where engine runs
# On single machine where engine does not run
# (On each host)

The implementation support each of these scenarios, the behavior in the 
engine is set in vdc_options. 

== Security considerations ==
The websocket server runs on a specific port and allows clients to connect to
any port on its machine. This is potential security risk (the attacker could
bypass the firewall on server). For further info see
https://github.com/kanaka/noVNC/issues/49. OpenStack implements customized
version of the proxy (openstack-nova-novncproxy package) and verifies the
security related information before connection to the target host is actually
created. With oVirt this is not easily possible since we don't store the VNC
ticket in the engine (afaik the only place in the system with knowledge of the
ticket, is the target host), so the verification is impossible. 

To address this issues, the websocket proxy uses digital signature to verify 
vnc data. This data is signed by the engine. 

== Secure communication ==
Secure communication is ensured by using TLS. For this reason, websockets
server must posses a key and certificate that is used for TLS communication.
Moreover the certificate must be trusted by users in their web browsers!

The creation of key/cert pair could be part of engine setup process (together
with jboss, apache and engine key/cert pairs).
