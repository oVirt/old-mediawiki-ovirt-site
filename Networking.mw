This page is for captuaring Networking related features we would like to have in oVirt going forward.
 
== Features ==
* SR-IOV support - Available via VDSM hook
* IPV6 support
* network SLA - VM QoS in 3.3, Host QoS in 3.4
* user defined networks (vlan ranges)
* IP allocations (melange in openstack, but forman has support as well) - 3.4 via Neutron integration
* security groups - 3.4 via Neutron integration
* permissions on networks (control who may attach what to which network)
* open vSwitch
* GRE tunneling (VPC - virtual private network) - 3.3 via Neutron integration
* Network roles (storage / live migration network etc.) - Migration in 3.3
* Sniff guest IP and report to the engine without guest tools
* Anti-spoofing layer two/three
* network groups
* dynamic network
* network lables - Available in 3.4
* Support nested vlans. (QinQ)

== Technologies / Stuff ==
* UCS integration
* Blade Harmony
* quantum/neutron integration - Available in 3.3, extended in 3.4
* 'network-manager' architecture - looking into re-designing the engine networking code.
* open flow
* Using Network manager vs. using scripts (VDSM level)
 
 
We'll open a wiki page for each of the above lines.
