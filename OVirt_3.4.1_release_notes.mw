{{DISPLAYTITLE:oVirt 3.4.1 Release Notes}}
The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of oVirt 3.4.1 release.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the  [[oVirt 3.4 Release Notes]],  [[oVirt 3.3.5 release notes]], [[oVirt 3.2 release notes]] and [[oVirt 3.1 release notes]].
For a general overview of oVirt, read [[oVirt 3.0 Feature Guide | the oVirt 3.0 feature guide]] and the [[about oVirt]] page.

= Install / Upgrade from previous versions=

==Fedora / CentOS / RHEL==

In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install 
 # yum localinstall http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release34.rpm

If you're upgrading from a previous version you should have ovirt-release package already installed on your system.
You can then install ovirt-release34.rpm as in a clean install side-by-side.
If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.4.0 you can now remove ovirt-release package:
 # yum remove ovirt-release

If you're upgrading from 3.3.2 or later, keep ovirt-release rpm in place until the upgrade is completed.
See [[oVirt 3.4.0 Release Notes]] for upgrading from previous versions.

If you're going to test  oVirt 3.4.1 development version, please add yourself to [[Testing/oVirt 3.4.1 testing]].


If you're installing oVirt 3.4.1 on a clean host you should read our [[Quick Start Guide]]

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.4.0 or from oVirt >= 3.3.2 you should just execute:
 # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
 # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt  <= 3.3.1 you must first upgrade to oVirt 3.3.5.
Please see [[oVirt 3.3.5 release notes]] for upgrading instructions.

== oVirt Node ==

A new oVirt Node ISO is available:
 http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.4/iso/ovirt-node-iso-3.4-20140508.2.el6.iso

== oVirt Live ==

A new oVirt Live ISO is available:
 http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.4/iso/ovirt-live-3.4.1.el6ev.iso

= What's New in 3.4.1? =

=Known issues=
* Host deployment may fail on EL6 system due to a recent tuned regression ({{BZ|1069119}}, {{BZ|1069245}}). Please downgrade tuned to previous version while waiting for a new tuned package solving this issue.
* ovirt-log-collector installation fails on Fedora 19 due to a conflict with sos 3.0 recently introduced also on release 19 ({{BZ|1037663}}) as workaround please downgrade sos before installing ovirt-engine:
  # yum downgrade sos
* after installing ovirt-engine yum update will fail on Fedora 19 due to sos 3.0 conflict with ovirt-log-collector  ({{BZ|1037663}})  as workaround please exclude sos from yum updates adding the following line in '''/etc/yum.conf''':
  exclude=sos
