= Chrome Support =

== Summary ==
Currently, the Google Chrome is not the recommended browser to use with ovirt for the following reasons:
* lack of SPICE/RDP support 
* rendering issues

As both WebAdmin and UserPortal are built using the Google Web Toolkit it is possible to make them work on Google Chrome.

== Lack of RDP/SPICE support ==
=== SPICE ===
For opening SPICE console the SPICE xpi/ActiveX plugin is used (xpi for Linux + FF, ActiveX for Windows + IE).
There are the following ways how to enable opening the SPICE console from Chrome:
* enable to use the xpi plugin on Chrome: http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/9679/
* walk around the plugin by opening the SPICE using remote-viewer/MIME binding: http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/11702/2 and http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/11703/
** remote-viewer with this support is not yet released even it has a corresponding patch upstream: 
* integrate the HTML5 implementation of SPICE (no work done yet, but will be done soon): http://www.spice-space.org/page/Html5

=== RDP ===
Currently it works on IE >= 7 (because it ships the msrdp.cab plugin).
* For opening it from chrome, a remote-viewer/MIME binding could be used as well (no work done yet, but will be done soon)
** remote-viewer with this support is not yet released even it has a corresponding patch upstream: 

=== Rendering Issues ===
There are several issues with proper rendering of the UI in Chrome but rarely reported:

== How to Contribute ==
After finishing and merging the above mentioned patches, the only issues will be the (mostly unknown) rendering ones.
* so, if you find an issue when using Chrome, please report it
* Feel free to browse bugzilla for finding such issues and fixing them
