* Vdsm is a very intensive piece of software and has some assumptions about coexisting with other software. We are trying to fix these issues but it's not our first priority.
* Vdsm exclusive write access to libvirt. NO OTHER PROCESS should be using libvirt on a Vdsm host.

==Configuring Vdsm==
Vdsm configuration file can be placed under ''/etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf''. If no such file exists Vdsm will only use its built-in defaults. Until you configure you Vdsm's private key and certificates, you should disable ssl. To do that, have your ''/etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf'' have

<pre>
[vars]
ssl = false
</pre>
