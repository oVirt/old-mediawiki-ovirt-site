== Edit Connection Properties ==

=== Summary ===
Allow edit (update) connection properties of an existing storage domain, rather than delete/create a new one.
This feature supports the distaster recovery agenda, and should allow quickly switching to work with another server  (that holds a backup/sync of the contents of the storage) in case of primary storage failure.
