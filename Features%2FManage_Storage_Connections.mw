== Edit Connection Properties ==

=== Summary ===
Allow edit (update) connection properties of an existing storage domain, rather than delete/create a new one.
This feature supports the disaster recovery agenda, and should allow quickly switching to work with another storage  that holds a backup/sync of the contents of the current storage in case of primary storage failure.

=== Current Status === 
* Edit  NFS connection properties in webadmin UI (http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/12372/)
* Edit Posix connection properties in webadmin UI (http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/13640/)
* Edit NFS, Posix connection properties in REST (design phase)
* Edit ISCSI connection properties in webadmin UI (not started)
* Edit ISCSI connection properties in REST (design phase)

== Detailed Description ==
While in UI and REST they are presented as one entity to the user, current backend implementation actually manages them separately.
In order to allow user to edit the connection details, there's a need to separate the notion of storage domain from its connection details, and allow editing just the connection details without editing the storage domain itself - since the storage domain is not changed, and it will continue to point to the same connection entity which will be updated by the user.
Connection can be edited when the storage domain is set to maintenance state, and in condition that the new location where it will point already has a sync/backup with the original storage contents.
