== Edit Connection Properties ==

=== Summary ===
This feature supports the disaster recovery agenda, and should allow quickly switching to work with another storage  that holds a backup/sync of the contents of the current storage in case of primary storage failure.
The feature introduces the ability to edit (update) connection properties of an existing storage domain, rather than delete the old one and create a new one.

=== Current Status === 
* Edit  NFS connection properties in webadmin UI (http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/12372/)
* Edit Posix connection properties in webadmin UI (http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/13640/)
* Allow deletion of connection only if no storage domains (nor lun disk in Iscsi case) are using it. (implementation phase)
* Edit NFS, Posix connection properties in REST (design phase)
* Edit ISCSI connection properties in webadmin UI (not started)
* Edit ISCSI connection properties in REST (design phase)
* Blocking bug in vdsm : https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=950055

== Detailed Description ==
While in UI and REST storage domain and the storage connection are presented as one united entity to the user, current backend implementation actually manages them separately.

In order to allow user to edit the connection details, there's a need to separate the notion of storage domain from its connection details, and allow editing just the connection details without editing the storage domain itself - since the storage domain is not changed, and it will continue to point to the same connection entity which will be updated by the user.
Connection can be edited when the storage domain is set to maintenance state, and in condition that the new location where it will point already has a sync/backup with the original storage contents.

== GUI ==
Storage domain and connection are managed together in webadmin UI in Storage tab --> specific storage entry open in a popup dialog.
Till now, storage domain's edit was enabled only for active storage domains and allowed changing their name and description.
In the scope of this feature, in order to allow editing the connection's details such as path for Posix and NFS storage domains, 
the edit button is now enabled for storage domains that are in maintenance state as well. 
In that case, name and description are disabled for edit.
For iscsi currently there is no option to edit the connection (target) details in webadmin UI.

== REST ==
In order to allow editing connections, a new root resource will be introduced that will allow add/edit/delete/get of connections to storage. 
=== New connection (POST) ===
It will be possible to create a new connection without adding a storage domain along with it, and later on  create a storage domain and relate it to existing connection
by providing the connection id.
=== Delete connection ===
Deletion of connection will be possible only if no storage domain is connected to it (orphan connection).
=== Update existing connection (PUT) === 
It will be possible to update connection details when storage domain connected to it is in maintenance state. Most of connection fields can be updated (such as path/iqn/address/port/user/password) - each storage type has its relevant set of fields, id of connection will be immutable.

In addition, for each storage domain it should be possible to view (GET) its storage connections by approaching it via a specific subresource: /api/storagedomains/<storageDomainId>/connections

== Database ==
Storage connections are managed in storage_server_connections table.
