== Running commands on endAction failure ==

=== Summary ===
This design discusses the need for running commands during the step of ending action on failure (as a part of rollback mechanism that does not depent on the VDSM verb RevertTask).

=== Current status ===
* Last updated date: Sun Feb 26 2012

=== Motivation ===
The motivation will be provided by an example (other flows may need this mechanism as well):
* AddVmFromTemplate command creates a VM based on a given template.
* The commands invokes internally for each image related with the template a CreateCloneFromTemplate command.
* CreateCloneFromTemplateCommand invokes the CopyImage VDSM verb.
* CopyImage is an asynchronous operation, and monitored by an async task. 
* If one of the of the tasks fails, all the sibling tasks should be reverted - this is usually done using the revert task mechanism. 
* The revert task mechanism performs the VDSM verb SPMRevertTask, but for there is no implementation of task reverting for CopyImage at VDSM. 
* Engine-core should implement a mechanism that will know how to issue an "opposite command" to the copy image for each successful sibling task to the failed task.

=== Detailed Description ===


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
Implementing such mechanism will contribute to resource consistency of engine-core, in a sense that no "leftover resources" will remain at VDSM.
