== Introduction ==

Although targeted at high performance computing Infiniband networks may be a quite cheap 
alternative to 10 Gigabit Ethernet. Nevertheless it is not an out of the box experience. So
you expectations should never be to get close to wire speed but to be happy with every MB/s
that you can reach beyond Giagbit Ethernet. This page should give a first impression for the 
interested reader what problems one might encounter.

== IPoIB ==

IP over Infiniband (IPoIB) is an encapsulation of TCP packets inside Infiniband packets. 
That adds a lot of overhead but comined with an NFS server it is the easiest setup that
is fully supported within OVirt.

=== Hypervisor node setup ===

On the hypervisor node you have to load the IPoIB required modules. These consist
of the driver of your card, the transport and a managing module. For Mellanox ConnectX
cards create a /etc/modules-load.d/ib.conf with the following lines

 <nowiki>mlx4_ib
ib_ipoib
ib_umad</nowiki>

After loading these modules you should see an Infiniband interface ib0 with ifconfig 
(additionally ib1 if you have a two port card). Add a new network inside OVirt and assign
it with a static IP to the interface.

=== Issues ===

This is a compilation of known problems. Feel free to extend it.

==== Mellanox TSO bug ====

The kernel advertises TSO for Mellanox ConnectX cards although it is not supported. Therefore the hardware creates corrupt IP fragments on sender side during large requests and the receiving client cannot use LRO. The result of a lengthy discussion is stated [http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-rdma/msg17787.html here]. So check if your Mellanox card has revision '''a0'''. Here an example of a non TSO compatible card:

 <nowiki>lspci | grep Mellanox
03:00.0 InfiniBand: Mellanox Technologies MT25418 [ConnectX VPI PCIe 2.0 2.5GT/s - IB DDR / 10GigE] (rev a0)
</nowiki>

If you have such an old card disable TSO and make that setting permanent in some startup script. 

 <nowiki>isOldCard=`lspci | grep Mellanox | grep a0 | wc -l`
if [ $isOldCard -gt 0 ]; then
  ethtool -K ib0 tso off
  ethtool -K ib1 tso off
fi
</nowiki>
