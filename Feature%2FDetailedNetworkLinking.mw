== Network Wiring ==

=== Summary ===
The network wiring feature is an enhancement for the VM Network Interface management.
It supports the following actions without unplugging the Vnic, maintaining the address of the Vnic:
:* Dynamically changing the network of a running VM (without unplugging the Vnic) <br>
:* Disconnecting a network of a VM without unplugging the vnic <br>

* Email: <alkaplan@redhat.com>

=== Current status ===
* On Design
* Last update date: 11/11/2012

=== Detailed Description ===

==== Engine Flows ====

===== Add Vnic =====
* 'connected' property of VmNetworkInterface should be stored in the DB
 VmNetworkInterfaceDAODbFacadeImpl- save
* The 'connect' property will be passed to the VDSM through when ActivateDecativateVm will be done.

===== Update Vnic =====
*'''shouldn't''' throw canDo when trying to update a nic when the vm is running and the nic is plugged.
* 'connected' property of VmNetworkInterface should also be stored in the DB
 VmNetworkInterfaceDAODbFacadeImpl- update
* If the vm is up
:* plugged->unplugged ('plugged' property was changed to false)
:** Unplug should be sent to the VDSM
:* unplugged->plugged
:** plug should be sent to the VDSM
:* plugged->plugged
:** updateVm should be sent to the VDSM.
:* unplugged->unplugged
:** nothing should be sent to VDSM

===== Remove Vnic =====
* no change (can be done only if the VM is down or the Vnic is unplugged)

===== Run VM =====
* When running a VM, the VM's Vnics' 'connected' property should also be passed to the VDSM.
 VmInfoBuilder- addNetworkInterfaceProperties

===== Plug nic =====
* no change.

===== Unplug nic =====

* no change.

==== Model ====
 vm_interface_view: (.schema)
 join vm_interface.connected as active

===== Error codes =====

translate VDSM error codes:
UPDATE_VNIC_FAILED = 'Failed to update VM Network Interface.'

==== VDSM API ====

A new API is added for this feature.

<pre>
updateVmInteface (params)
</pre>

<pre>
params = {
'vmId': vmUUID, 
'nic':  
       {'type': 'interface',
        'device': 'bridge|sriov|vnlink|bridgeless',
        'network': 'network name',                      <--- bridge name
        'connected': 'is network connected',
        'address': 'PCI address dictionary',            <--- PCI = {'type':'pci', 'domain':'0x0000', 'bus':'0x00', 'slot':'0x0c', 'function':'0x0'}

        'bootOrder': <int>,                             <--- global boot order across all bootable devices
        'promisc': <blue,red>,                          <--- promisc mirror mode, the interface will mirror all red and blue bridge traffic
        'specParams': params dictionary,
        'nicModel': 'pv|rtl8139|e1000'}
 }
</pre>

Updated folowes:
hotplugNic- the vdsm should connect the Vnic's Network according to the 'connected' property passed on the Vnic.
createVm- the vdsm should connect each of the Vm's Vnics according to the 'connected' property passed on the each Vnic.
New vdsm errors will be added: 
<pre>
UPDATE_VNIC_FAILED- code 51
</pre>
