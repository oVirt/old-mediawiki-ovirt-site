== Network Wiring ==

=== Summary ===
The network wiring feature is an enhancement for the VM Network Interface management.
It supports the following actions without unplugging the Vnic, maintaining the address of the Vnic:
:* Dynamically changing the network of a running VM (without unplugging the Vnic) <br>
:* Disconnecting a network of a VM without unplugging the vnic <br>

=== Owner ===
* Name: [[User:alkaplan| Alona Kaplan]]
* Email: <alkaplan@redhat.com>

=== Current status ===
* On Design
* Last update date: 11/11/2012

=== Detailed Description ===

==== Engine Flows ====

===== Add nic =====

*when adding Network Interface Properties 'connected' property shuld also be added (VmInfoBuilder- addNetworkInterfaceProperties)

===== Update nic =====

*throw canDo when trying to update a nic when the vm is running and the nic is plugged.

===== Remove nic =====

*remove the nic only if the VM is down or nic is deactivated

===== Run VM =====
* When running a VM, the VM's Vnics' 'connected' property should also be passed to the VDSM.
:* VmInfoBuilder- addNetworkInterfaceProperties

===== Plug nic =====

*plugging a nic when a VM is down updates its plugged flag in 
vm_device table to 'true'. If the VM is up then the VDSM is also being called to plug it.

===== Unplug nic =====

*when unplugging a nic update its plugged flag in vm_device table to 'false' and clear the address

==== Engine API ====
<!--
- plug or unplug a nic

 VdcAction.java
 ...
 plugUnplugNic(1000)

 plugUnplugVmNicParameters.java
 Guid vmId;
 Guid nicId;
 boolean plug;
-->

===== Error codes =====

translate VDSM error codes:
TODO

==== VDSM API ====

A new API is added for this feature.
<!--
<pre>
hotplugNic (params)
</pre>

<pre>
params = {
'vmId': vmUUID, 
'nic':  
       {'type': 'interface',
        'device': 'bridge|sriov|vnlink|bridgeless',
        'network': 'network name',                      <--- bridge name
        'address': 'PCI address dictionary',            <--- PCI = {'type':'pci', 'domain':'0x0000', 'bus':'0x00', 'slot':'0x0c', 'function':'0x0'}
        'macAddr': 'mac address',
        'bootOrder': <int>,                             <--- global boot order across all bootable devices
        'promisc': <blue,red>,                          <--- promisc mirror mode, the interface will mirror all red and blue bridge traffic
        'specParams': params dictionary,
        'nicModel': 'pv|rtl8139|e1000'}
 }
</pre>

New vdsm errors will be added: 
<pre>
'Failed to hotplug NIC' - code 49
'Failed to hotunplug NIC' - code 50
</pre>

'''Note:'''  To avoid PCI addresses collisions Engine should clean NIC's address entry in DB when unplug the NIC. <BR>
The new address will be assigned to NIC with next plugging. <BR>
