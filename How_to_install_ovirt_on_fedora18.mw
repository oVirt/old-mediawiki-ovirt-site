Clean F18 vdsm

-Installation -
There are several workarounds that have to be made prior to connect the engine to the Fedora18 host.

After RPM installation
Bootstrapping fails. unable to create bridge.
        - workaround - prior to connecting the hypervisor to the engine, create bridge manually.
         1.disable NetworkManager: systemctl disable NetworkManager.service
         2.stop NetworkManager: systemctl stop NetworkManager.service
         3. add a bridge: brctl add ovirtmgmt
         4. add ifcfg scripts to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts in the following convention.


         ifcfg-eth0
         DEVICE=eth0
         ONBOOT=yes
         BOOTPROTO=none
         HWADDR=xx:xx:xxxx:xx:xx
         BRIDGE=ovirtmgmt
         NM_CONTROLLED=no


        ifcfg-ovirtmgmt
        DEVICE=ovirtmgmt
        TYPE=Bridge
        ONBOOT=yes
        DELAY=0
        NM_CONTROLLED=no
        NETBOOT=yes
        BOOTPROTO=dhcp
        ONBOOT=yes

5. connect bridge to eth interface: 

        brctl addif ovirtmgmt eth0
6. disable selinux: 

        setenforce 0
7. restart network service: 

        systemctl restart network.service

Failure to connect engine to host

this is due to the bootstrap trying to configure the iptables on the host. in Fedora 18 iptables has been replaced with firewalld.
a workaround is disabling and stopping firewalld:

       systemctl disable firewalld.service
       systemctl stop firewalld.service

VDSM can't find network interface  - this is due to the fact that ifconfig has been removed from fedora 18's default installation
a workaround would be installing net-tools: 

       yum install net-tools

After installing you will need to reboot the machine manually because the bootstrap will fail to do it.

       reboot
