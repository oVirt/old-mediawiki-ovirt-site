= Vdsm Coding Guidelines =

* Vdsm is written in Python (at least mostly), and its coding style should follow the best practices of Python coding, unless otherwise declared.
* PEP8 is holy
* API calls and arguments are mixedCased, but new internal modules should use underscore_separated_names.
* Class names are in CamelCase
* All indentation is made of the space characters. Tabs are evil.
* Whitespace between code stanzas help to breath while reading code.
* Let logging method do the formatting for you:
 logging.debug('hello %s', 'world')
Rather than
 logging.debug('hello %s' % 'world')
