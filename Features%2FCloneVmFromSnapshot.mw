=== Detailed Description ===
A user will be able to create snapshots for a given virtual machine, and then to select a given snapshot and peform a clone of the VM.<BR>
The disks of the cloned VM will represent a "collapsed" state of the selected snapshot<BR>
(i.e: If the user selected to clone from the N-th snapshot, the disks of the cloned VM will be created by copying images from the snapshot chain of the first snapshot till the Nth snapshot, and then collapsing them). <BR>
The user will be be able to select different storage domains to hold the destination disks and to change their volume type and format. <BR>
The user will also be able to provide VM information (such as VM name) which will be based on the VM information of the original VM. <BR>



=== Benefit to oVirt ===
If we look at snapshots as "checkpoints" of VM state + data , and "checkpoints" are made in significant points of time, the feature allows a user to create a VM based on a significant point of time of another VM, and use the cloned VM, without interfering with the original VM (i.e - no need to perform collapse on images of the source VM).
