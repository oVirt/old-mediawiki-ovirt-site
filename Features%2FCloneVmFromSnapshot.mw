=== Current status ===
* Last updated date: Wed Jan 18 2012

=== Detailed Description ===
1.A user will be able to create snapshots for a given virtual machine, and then to select a given snapshot and perform a clone of the VM.<BR>
2.The disks of the cloned VM will represent a "collapsed" state of the selected snapshot<BR>
3.A clone can be performed on a VM regardless of its status (i.e - can be performed if a VM is UP or down as long as the images are available) <BR>
4.In order to prevent concurrent flows from modifying the original images that relate to the snapshot chain will the clone is taking place, these images should be locked <BR>
5.The user will also be able to provide VM information (such as VM name) which will be based on the VM information of the original VM. <BR>
6.The original VM configuration for a given snapshot will be retrieved by the UI , using a dedicated query carried out on oVirt-engine core <BR>
7.The user will be be able to select different storage domains to hold the destination disks and to change their drive mapping,volume type and format. <BR>
8. If a disk that an image of it appeared in the snapshot chain is deleted, upon clone vm from snapshot, the images of the disk will not be copied (the cloned VM will not have a copy of the disk) and a proper event should be logged.<BR>
9. A shared disk that is a part of the clone VM from snapshot operation should be unplugged at the destination VM. It is the responsablity of the user to plug it, if desired. <BR>
10. For a disk residing on direct LUN, the feature still need to be defined. <BR>

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
If we look at snapshots as "checkpoints" of VM state + data , and "checkpoints" are made in significant points of time, the feature allows a user to create a VM based on a significant point of time of another VM, and use the cloned VM, without interfering with the original VM (i.e - no need to perform collapse on images of the source VM).
