== Clone VM from snapshot ==

=== Summary ===
This feature will let users of oVirt engine to create a VM based on a given snapshot

=== Current status ===
* Last updated date: Wed Jan 18 2012

=== Detailed Description ===

==== User interface ====
1.A user will be able to create snapshots for a given virtual machine, and then to select a given snapshot and perform a clone of the VM.<BR>
2.The user will also be able to provide VM information (such as VM name) which will be based on the VM information of the original VM. <BR>
3.The original VM configuration for a given snapshot will be retrieved by the UI , using a dedicated query carried out on oVirt-engine core <BR><BR>
4.The user will be be able to select different storage domains to hold the destination disks and to change their drive mapping,volume type and format. <BR>

==== Cloning of images behavior ====
5.The disks of the cloned VM will represent a "collapsed" state of the selected snapshot<BR>
6.A clone can be performed on a VM regardless of its status (i.e - can be performed if a VM is UP or down as long as the images are available) <BR>
7.In order to prevent concurrent flows from modifying the original images that relate to the snapshot chain will the clone is taking place, these images should be locked <BR>
8. If a disk that an image of it appeared in the snapshot chain is deleted, upon clone vm from snapshot, the images of the disk will not be copied <BR>
(the cloned VM will not have a copy of the disk) and a proper event should be logged.<BR>

==== Hot plugged disks ====
9. During creating a snapshot, the "pluggable" attribute of a disk will be stored in the VM configuration. <BR>
Clone VM from Snapshot will be indifferent to this attribute, in a sense the destination disk will be created with the same value<BR>
of the attribute as its corresponding source disk.

==== Shared disks and direct LUN diskes behavior ====
10. For shared disks and direct LUN based disks, the user who performs the snapshot will specify whether the disk should be plugged or unplugged
upon performing the clone. <BR>


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
If we look at snapshots as "checkpoints" of VM state + data , and "checkpoints" are made in significant points of time, the feature allows a user to create a VM based on a significant point of time of another VM, and use the cloned VM, without interfering with the original VM (i.e - no need to perform collapse on images of the source VM).
