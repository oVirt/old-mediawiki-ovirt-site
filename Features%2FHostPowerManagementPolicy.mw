Goals:
* shutdown a host when Powersaving is selected and engine clears the host (migrates all VMs elsewhere)
* wake up a host when the available resources get below configured level

Design:
* shutdown methods: standard engine's fencing methods - IPMI, SSH, Drac
* wake methods: standard methods - IPMI, SSH, ... - with fallback to WOL when needed and supported
* use Start/StopVdsCommand internally

Shutdown rules:
* decided as part of load balancing thread
* host has been empty for some time (configurable timeout)
* there is enough available hosts in the cluster even without this host
* make sure spm is not killed

Wake Up rule:
* decided as part of load balancing thread
* not enough free hosts in the cluster

UI:
* Cluster policy needs to allow the user to set:
** the minimum amount of free hosts
** whether host shutdown is allowed
** how long does a host need to be empty to be considered for shutdown
* Each host needs a boolean that will override the shutdown (persistent host)

Known issues:
* when user tries to start a Vm that is pinned to a powered down host, we will fail the start

Possible future enhancements:
* Reserve defined in terms of power, memory, ...
** useful for reserving space for fast start of some important VM
** bogomips used as the CPU power unit (/proc/cpuinfo)
* Wake On Lan fencing method:
** each host has to report MAC and WOL capability for each NIC
** locality information to know who can send the proper WOL packet  (each host will report it's ARP database of visible MAC addresses for  each NIC)
