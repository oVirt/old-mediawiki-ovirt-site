== REST API session management ==

=== Summary ===
The purpose of the feature is to add session management to the oVirt REST API.

=== Current status ===
* Design phase

=== Requirements ===
#Provide a session management mechanism that would allow clients to use the oVirt API without requiring them to pass credentials on each call
#Reduce the overhead and also without the extra overhead of logging in and out in each request.
#Continue supporting the old mechanism, in which credentials are passed in every request (no login/logout optimization, just the same as today).

=== Detailed Description ===
Today, when working with the API (via the CLI, SDK, curl, browser or any other web client), the credentials must be passed in each and every request made to the API.
Also, in each such request the REST API initiates a login and logout to the engine core.
The purpose of this feature is to allow clients to perform some initial login phase, work with the same session for multiple requests, and then close it (or leave it open until it is closed for inactivity).

=== Implementation ===
The proposed implementation for that is to rely on cookies in the following way:
#First, the client does a request providing credentials, with a special Header field: "Prefer: persistent-auth".
#The server logs in to the engine, with session-id that is equal to JSESSIONID, and performs the required action. The JSESSIONID cookie is returned automatically to the client.
#The client gets the cookie, and (if he wants to) in the second request he passes it to the server, and also pass the persistent-auth header as before. No need to pass credentials.
#The server gets the cookie, validates the session with the engine-core, performs the request, and returns. Again, the JSESSIONID cookie is returned automatically to the client.
#After few such requests the client can choose to close the session, by passing the JSESSIONID cookie, and not using the "Prefer" header (note that if it isn't used then the session will be closed after some timeout).
#The server sees the JSESSIONID cookie, and that there is no need to keep the session (no "Prefer" header) and it closes the session (both in the engine-core, and in the application server).

IMPORTANT NOTE:
*Existing clients can continue working as they are working today. They just ignore the JSESSIONID cookie, and pass credentials on each call. No need to provide the "Prefer" header. The API will then do login and logout on every such call.
