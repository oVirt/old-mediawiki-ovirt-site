== I18N support <!-- The name of your feature --> ==

=== Summary ===
This feature will allow using non English characters as properties of entities (e.g. Tag name).

=== Owner ===
<!--This should link to your home wiki page so we know who you are-->

* Name: [[User:TJelinek| TJelinek]]

<!-- Include you email address that you can be reached should people want to contact you about helping with your feature, status is requested, or  technical issues need to be resolved-->
* Email: <tjelinek@redhat.com>

=== Current status ===
* VDSM, API, Installer prepared to be tested
* Engine waiting for patch: [http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#change,3354]
* Frontend (Webadmin, Userportal-gwtp) waiting for patch: [http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#change,3353]

=== Scope ===
Not all fields supports non-ASCII characters. The reason is, that some fields are stored to storage domains.
VDSM already supports UTF for storage domain, but only for storage domain level 3. However, oVirt Engine does 
not support storage domain level 3 yet.

There are two categories of fields which are stored in storage domain. Those, which are stored directly and those, 
which are stored as part of OVF(Open Virtualization Format) files. None of them can contain non-ASCII chars. 
This fields are:

* fields saved in storage domain
** Host name/address
** Network name
** Domain name/description 
** Data Center name/description
** Volume/image description
** NFS Storage Export Path
* Fields which are part of OVF
** VM name
** VM description
** Template name
** Template description
** Snapshot Description
** Storage Domain Name
** Disk Alias/Description

One field which directly belongs to none of the categories above but can not contain non-ASCII chars is the VM Pool name.
The reason is that the VM Pool name determines the VM name, so it has to be treated the same way as VM Name which is stored in OVF.


All other fields supports non-ASCII chars
 
== Components Involved ==

=== VDSM ===
VDSM already supports storage domain level3. For storage domain level3 it supports also UTF. 
As mentioned above, oVirt Engine does not support storage domain level3, so the fields mentioned
above are out of the scope of this feature.

VDSM is I18N prepared.

=== API ===
Does not do any validation - it fully relies on engine.

It means that API is I18N prepared.

=== Installer ===
It is I18N prepared. Fields which are validated:
* host address
* domain location

Fields which are not validated but are dangerous:
* DB password
* admin password

=== Webadmin, Userportal-gwtp ===

Fields which are not validated should work out of the box. Following a table which enumerates the fields which are validated.
