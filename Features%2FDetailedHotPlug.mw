<!-- Provide the details of the feature. What is it going to include. See the sub-sections below. This section may contain more sub-sections, depends on the oVirt projects relevant for this feature. -->
The following feature will allow to hot plug/unplug of virtIO disks on running vm, also in scope of that feature will be added a new attribute to disk which will allow to run vm
even the following disk is unaccesiable. <BR>
This feature will be restricted to operating systems that support this action – eg. RHEL 5/6, Windows Server 2003 and Windows server 2008. <BR>

==== Entity Description ====

A new field should be added to the table image_vm_map which will indicate status of disk (plugged, unplugged) for current vm <BR>
A new field should be added to the table images, type boolean, which will indicate if a disk is plugged or unplugged <BR>

==== CRUD ====
<!-- Describe the create/read/update/delete operations on the entities, and what each operation should do. -->

New actions will allow the user to plug or unplug a disk to/from a running VM, it will be allowed only for disks which were added to vm by AddDiskToVMCommand . The feature will be allowed only on 3.1 clusters and above <BR>
Via UI or the API the user will have an option to plug or unplug a disk of a running VM. <BR>
The action will be allowed in the following flows: <BR>
HotPlug will be allowed only on: <BR>
1. Operation system of guest is supports operation <BR>
2. VirtIO disk <BR>
3. Disk should be unplugged <BR>
4. VM should be in status Up <BR>
HotUnPlug will be allowed in the following cases: <BR>
1. Operation system of guest is supports operation <BR>
2. VirtIO disk <BR>
3. VM should be in status Up <BR>
4. Disk should be plugged <BR>


In order to perform an operation new verbs will be added at VDSM side: <BR>
hotplug and hotunplug with the following dictionary to pass: <BR>
A call to vdsm will be done in synchronious way <BR>

        {'type': 'disk',
