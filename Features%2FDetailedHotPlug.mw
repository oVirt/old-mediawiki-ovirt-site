2. Disk should be unplugged <BR>
3. VM should be in status Up <BR>
4. Disk can not be system <BR>
HotUnPlug will be allowed in the following cases: <BR>
1. VirtIO disk <BR>
2. VM should be in status Up <BR>
3. Disk should be plugged <BR>
4. Disk can not be system <BR>

In order to perform an operation new verbs will be added at VDSM side: <BR>
hotplug and hotunplug with the following dictionary to pass: <BR>


'device': [   
        {'type': 'disk',
         'device': 'disk',
         'index': <int>,                            <--- disk index unique per 'iface' virtio|ide
         'address': 'PCI|IDE address dictionary',   <--- PCI = {'type':'pci', 'domain':'0x0000', 'bus':'0x00', 'slot':'0x0c', 'function':'0x0'} ,

         'domainID': 'domain UUID',                     | 
         'imageID': 'image UUID',                   <--- Should be passed on of 3 options: (poolID, domainID, imageID, volumeID) or GUID or UUID   
         'volumeID': 'volume UUID',                     |
         'UUID': 'shared disk UUID',                <--- Should be passed on of 3 options: (poolID, domainID, imageID, volumeID) or GUID or UUID    
         'GUID': 'shared disk GUID'}]
