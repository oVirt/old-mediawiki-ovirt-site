Based on the website redesign plans (see reference links, below), the WordPress-based site at ovirt.org will be merged with this oVirt wiki. The pages from the WP ovirt.org site need to migrate to new homes on the wiki, which redirects where necessary to avoid breaking links.

Colour codes:
* <span style="background-color:tomato">Page creation/copy needed, or link not yet identified</span>
* <span style="background-color:orange">in progress</span>
* <span style="background-color:springgreen">Done</span>

=== Pages from Wordpress-based oVirt Site (in order of traffic): ===

=== Links needed in new wiki ===

The following are links in the staging wiki which are currently dead. We need to either match them up with existing pages (in Replacement Page, indicate the name of the page in the current wiki to point to) or create pages to ensure no dead links. This list was auto-generated by the [[Special:PagesWanted]] page.
