{{Feature|name=Upgrade Manager|modules=engine,infra|status=To be Released|version=3.6.0}}

== Summary ==
The process of upgrading cluster/hosts to a higher version is a manual process. When working with a small cluster of hosts that suffice. However, on large clusters it is very time-consuming to upgrade all the hosts manually. The purpose of this feature is to give administrators a set of tools to know when an upgrade is available (engine/hosts), upgrade separate hosts, and upgrade cluster as a whole, using rolling upgrade process.

== Benefit to oVirt ==
Upgrade is a big pain point on large oVirt deployments. The existence of tools to ease the upgrade process will make it easier to adopt oVirt.

== Requirements ==
The set of tools that are in the scope of this feature are:
# Notify the user that an update for the engine is available
# Make it ease to know whether a host has an available update, and what cluster levels this update supports
# Allow the user to upgrade a specific host automatically
# Allow the user to do a rolling cluster upgrade, either to a higher cluster level, or to a new version that supports the current one

== User Experience ==
=== Notify the user that an update for the engine is available ===
After the administrator logs in to the Administrator Portal, he will get a dialog notifying on a new available update. He can choose whether to "dismiss" this notification or not.
If he chooses to dismiss it, the only other way of knowing that an update is available is by going to the "About" dialog, and looking for the information there. If an update is available it will appear there. Whether there is an update or not will be checked periodically every X days. Open question here - do we need to support checking whether an update is available by demand?

=== Make it ease to know whether a host has an available update, and what cluster levels this update supports ===
=== Allow the user to upgrade a specific host automatically ===
=== Allow the user to do a rolling cluster upgrade, either to a higher cluster level, or to a new version that supports the current one ===
