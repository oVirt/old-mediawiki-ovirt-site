=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
The goal is install only packages needed to integrate oVirt Node with others project like Cockpit (for example).

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
As all source will be splitted by RPM, we could drop the current TUI code and add the dependecy to cockpit as default interface to users.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->
 [[Features/Node/Cockpit | Cockpit]].

=== Testing ===
Build ovirt node project and it should generate the following rpms:  ovirt-node-plugin-snmp-logic, ovirt-node-plugin-cim-logic, ovirt-node-lib, ovirt-node-lib-config, ovirt-node- cli-tools, ovirt-node-tui-installer, ovirt-node-tui-setup, ovirt-node-lib-legacy. In the end, you could install the 'core' of ovirt-node, like: ovirt-node-lib and ovirt-node-lib-config without the tui subpackages.
