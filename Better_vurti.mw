== Motivation ==
* We want to scale easily
* Limited number of host and VMs 
* High performance costs with large deployment
* Want to prepare for the 2-way messaging with hosts
* write better loosely coupled code - more testable, maintainable, easy to add

== Problem statement ==
* unparalleled code - code uses closed calls (syncing objects, using locks) - not parallel
* thread waste - we keep a thread per host connection, pooled. Most of the threads in the system are busy doing VURTI
* thread bound - large deployments needs more threads to cope with 
* latency in updates - large deployments cause each VURTI cycle to last longer - meaning we deal with state change later then expected.
* many reads and writes - although been thorough an optimisation cycle, system relies heavily on db round-trips.
* code around VM life-cycle and Host life-cycle is intestable, period. this means longer verification cycle, no unit testing of new,modified code etc.

== Approach ==
Lets break this conceptually first to 2 parts, the communication and the actual update cycle. Update cycle is the actual stop-the-world list of checks

and loops on data structures, which then we assume state change upon. Communication is everything from the http connection pool when the host is added

and the direct blocking calls we do to fetch aggregated data from our agents (also take actions on but less relevant for now)

=== poll to push - Reactive Programming  ===
while not ready 2 way communication can lead us to get rid of polling. this would eliminate the need for a constant thread 

per abstract in this layer adopting to simulate the poll to push by programming event driven style, using CDI events.

=== Phase 1 - Abstract the communication layer ===

today the sequence of action is linear - we lock, poll data from vdsm, iterate, take actions, do state change, save all to db and free lock.

the communication layer is coupled inside, we don't have a way around it. to overcome this we introduce another level of indirection - the PushAdapter.

==== PushAdapter ====
Typically the PushAdapter will poll for data exactly as made today but instead of just iterating and doing the regular stuff it will throw events. 

The adapter main role is to crunch the fetch data and dispatch events accordingaly,  i.e

VMStateChanged is an example of an aggregating event the will be fired. multiple subscribers(a.k.a observers) can react to that (ordering of events is
