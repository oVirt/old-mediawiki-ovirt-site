=== Overview ===
In a highly consolidated and shared environment found in the virtual datacenter, storage
bandwidth often comes up as a significant root cause of performance problems. In order to help
users mitigate these bottlenecks, they have requested the ability to have finer grained controls
over an individual VMâ€™s ability to consume storage bandwidth. This will allow them to set
maximum thresholds on individual VMs and Disk files so as to prevent misbehaving VMs from
impacting the performance of other VMs sharing the same hosts, storage pools, or even same
storage array.
There are two key metrics that libvirt can enable users to set limits on: Throughput (in
Bytes/Second) and IO Operations (Input/Output Operations/Second). There is a typical dynamic
is storage I/O that is often seen in which a smaller number of large files being read or written
often consume fewer IOps, but operate at a higher throughput. Conversely, when a large
number of small files are being read or written, there are typically a higher number of IOps but
noticeably slower total throughput. It is strongly suggested that users thoroughly understand
their workload characteristics in order to properly set limits on I/O at various levels, as a
misconfiguration could cause potential downtime and outages to running workloads.
