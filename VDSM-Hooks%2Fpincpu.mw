The pincpu hook will ping the VM's virtual CPUs to specific host CPUs.
Can be used to map a VM to a specific subset of host CPUs in order to comply with specific licensing requirements or to improve performance under certain loads

Usage:
pincpu="0" (use the first cpu)
pincpu="1-4" (use cpus 1-4)
pincpu="^3" (dont use cpu 3)
pincpu="1-4,^3,6" (all of the above)

syntax:
 pincpu=1
will pin the vm to cpu 1
