==Summary==
This feature allows the administrators to maintain the snapshots of a Gluster volume. Administrator can create, start, stop, delete and restore to a given snapshot. Gluster volume snapshot provides an online crash consistency mechanism for the Gluster volumes. The volume snaps provide a point in time view of the volume. In a case of inconsistency, these snaps could be used to restore the volume to a consistent stage. The snaps are also a mechanism of volume backup for future references.

Using this feature, an admin can take scheduled or unscheduled snapshots of and thereby backup a Gluster volume. This also provides a check-point in time to restore to, if and when necessary.

== Current Status ==

* Status: Inception
* Last updated date: Thu Dec 26 2013

== Detailed Description ==
An online snapshot is a feature where the file-system and associated data continue to be available for the clients, while the snapshot is being taken. Here the onus lies on the application to periodically sync data, so that the snap created has the desired data consistent view.

On the other hand, an offline snapshot makes the file-system offline or unavailable for a deterministic time-window till the snapshot is taken. While offline snapshots are relatively easy to administer, the inaccessibility to the volume(s)/data is a major disadvantage.

=== Consistency Group ===
Applications might consume multiple Gluster volumes and might require the resulting snapshot of these volumes to be from the same point in time view. This group of volumes forms a consistency group. If a volume belongs to a consistency group, then that volume can only be snapped as part of the named consistency group. Restore would also be permitted only on the consistency group. Addition or removal of volumes to/from a consistency group is allowed.


With this feature the user will be able to
* Create snaps of volumes
* View all the snaps taken for a volume
* Restore a volume to a given snapshot
* Define a consistency group
* Delete an existing snapshot
* Start / Stop a snapshot
* View the current status of snapshot
* Define the values for the snapshot configuration parameters
* List view the snapshot configuration parameters
