==Summary==
This feature allows the administrators to maintain the snapshots of a Gluster volume. Administrator can create, start, stop, delete and restore to a given snapshot. Gluster volume snapshot provides an online crash consistency mechanism for the Gluster volumes. The volume snaps provide a point in time view of the volume. In a case of inconsistency, these snaps could be used to restore the volume to a consistent stage. The snaps are also a mechanism of volume backup for future references.

Using this feature, an admin can take scheduled or unscheduled snapshots of and thereby backup a Gluster volume. This also provides a check-point in time to restore to, if and when necessary.

== Current Status ==

* Status: Inception
* Last updated date: Thu Dec 26 2013

== Detailed Description ==
An online snapshot is a feature where the file-system and associated data continue to be available for the clients, while the snapshot is being taken. Here the onus lies on the application to periodically sync data, so that the snap created has the desired data consistent view.

On the other hand, an offline snapshot makes the file-system offline or unavailable for a deterministic time-window till the snapshot is taken. While offline snapshots are relatively easy to administer, the inaccessibility to the volume(s)/data is a major disadvantage.

=== Consistency Group ===
Applications might consume multiple Gluster volumes and might require the resulting snapshot of these volumes to be from the same point in time view. This group of volumes forms a consistency group. If a volume belongs to a consistency group, then that volume can only be snapped as part of the named consistency group. Restore would also be permitted only on the consistency group. Addition or removal of volumes to/from a consistency group is allowed.


With this feature the user will be able to
* Create snaps of volumes
* View all the snaps taken for a volume
* Restore a volume to a given snapshot
* Define a consistency group
* Delete an existing snapshot
* Start / Stop a snapshot
* View the current status of snapshot
* Define the values for the snapshot configuration parameters
* List view the snapshot configuration parameters

=== User Experience and control flows ===
==== Main Tab "Consistency Groups" ====
An additional main tab item would be introduced for "Consistency Groups". This tab would list the consistency group in the cluster in tabular form having the columns -
* Name
* Cluster
* Volumes (# of volumes in the consistency group)
* Snaps (# of snaps taken for the consistency group)


[[File:CGList.png]]


Actions supported for the main tab are -
* New - creates a new consistency group
* Remove - removes the consistency group
* Create Snap - takes a snapshot of the consistency group
* Add Volumes - add new volumes to the consistency group
* Remove Volumes - removes volumes from the consistency group


[[File:CGList1.png]]


The sub-tabs for the individual consistency groups would be having tabs -
* Configurations
* Snapshots

==== Sub-tab "Consistency Groups --> Configurations" ====
This sub-tab lists the snapshot configuration values set for the consistency group. The configuration parameters are listed in tabular form having two columns -
* Parameter Name
* Parameter Value


[[File:ParamList.png]]


Actions supported for this sub-tab are -
* Add - to add a new configuration parameter
* Edit - Edit the value of a configuration parameter
* Reset - Reset the value of the configuration parameter to system value
* Reset All - Reset the value of all the configuration parameters to system values


[[File:ParamList1.png]]

==== Sub-tab "Consistency Groups --> Snapshots" ====
This sub-tab lists the snapshots for the consistency group in a tabular form. The details listed for a snapshot in the list are -
* Status (as an icon)
* Name
* Description
* Creation Time (makes easy for administrator to decide while restore)


[[File:SnapsList.png]]


Actions supported for this sub-tab are -
* Start - starts the snapshot
* Stop - stops the snapshot
* Restore - restores the consistency group to the said snapshot
* Remove - removes the selected snapshots


[[File:SnapsList1.png]]

==== Main tab Volumes ====
A new action group "Volume Snapshot" would be introduced under actions for a volume as a drop down. The set of actions under this action group would be -
* Create Snapshot
* Restore

[[File:VolumeList.png]]

<big>1. Create Snapshot</big>

Without selecting a volume from the list, if user clicks the action "Create Snapshot", the create snapshot dialog opens. User can snap the individual consistency groups and volumes using the dialog by selecting them clicking the button "Snap". User can also create a fresh consistency group and snap it using this dialog by selecting multiple volumes from the list and clicking the button "Snap as Consistency Group".

If user selects an individual volume from the list and clicks the menu option "Volume Snapshot --> Create Snapshot" the snapshot creation is triggered without opening a dialog. Similarly if a volume is selected from the table which is part of consistency group and clicks the menu option "Volume Snapshot --> Create Snapshot", a confirmation dialog stating "Volume [Volume Name] is part of a consistency group. Do you want to take snapshot for the consistency group?" asks for the confirmation of taking a snap of the consistency group it belongs to. If user selects to create the snapshot, it is triggered accordingly.

<big>2. Restore a Snapshot</big>

Without selecting a volume from the list, if the user clicks the action "Volume Snapshot --> Restore", the Restore Snapshot dialog opens. User can select a consistency group or volume and all the snaps of the same get listed in a table. User can select the snap he/she wants to restore to and click the button "OK". User is prompted for a confirmation for restore and then restore is triggered.

[[File:RestoreSnap.png]]

If the user selects an individual volume from the list and clicks the menu "Volume Snapshots --> Restore", the above dialog pops up with volume name auto populated and disabled. User can select a snap to restore to and clock "OK". If the user selects a volume which is part of a consistency group and clicks the menu option "Volume Snapshots --> Restore", the Restore snapshot dialog opens with name of consistency group already populated and disabled. User can select the snap to restore to and click "OK". User is prompted for a confirmation for restore and then restore is triggered.

==== Sub-tab "Volumes --> Snapshot" ====
This sub-tab under the main tab Volumes lists the snapshots created for individual volumes. The set of supported actions are -
* Restore
* Remove
