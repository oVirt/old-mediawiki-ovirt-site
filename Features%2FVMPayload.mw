=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
There are many cases in which there is a need to pass a payload to a VM. For example, running windows sysprep, external management of installation of 3rd party products, and etc.
The purpose of the feature is to allow adding such a payload externally, specify the payload method (CD, floppy), specify when this data has to be available, and etc.

The payload options are:
# Availability
#* Permanent payload - payload which will be available in the guest at all times
#* Temporary payload - via "run-once" - will be available only when running the guest via the run-once option
#* No payloads - the VM won't get any payload upon startup/run-once
# Payload passing method
#* Floppy
#* CD
#* In the future also injection and payload via private IP

Notes:
# The payload data will be encoded using base64 encoding. The engine will decode the data, and payload it via the required method.
# The may be multiple payloads
# All payloads will be passed in the same method

{ 'iso': [{'filename': 'content' }, {'filename': 'content'}],
  'floppy': [{'filename': 'content' }, {'filename': 'content'}],
  'sysprep': {'filename': 'content' },
  'network': '...' } 
 </nowiki>

=== User work-flows ===

The Administrator and User Portal should allow the following operations in edit VM:
# Enable/Disable payload
# Once enabled
#* Choose payload method
#** Floppy
#** CD
#* For each payload
#* Choose the path
#* Provide the base64 data

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
The VM payload feature will ease the installation of third party products, mainly in a cloud environment.
