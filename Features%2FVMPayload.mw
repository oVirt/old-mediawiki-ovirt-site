=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
There are many cases in which there is a need to add some payload to a VM. For example, running windows sysprep, external management of installation of 3rd party products in the VM, and etc.
The purpose of the feature is to allow adding such a payload externally, specify the payload method (ISO, floppy), specify when this data has to be available, and etc.

The payload options are:
# Availability
#* Permenant payload - payload which will be available in the guest at all times
#* Temporary payload - via "run-once" - will be available only when running the guest via the run-once option
#* No payloads - the VM won't get any payload upon startup/run-once
# Payload methods
#* Floppy
#* ISO
#* In the future also injection and payload via private IP

Notes:
# The payload data will be encoded using base64 encoding. The engine will decode the data, and payload it via the required method.
# The payload may consist of one or more files, all will be available via the same payload method


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
The VM payload feature will ease the installation of third party products, mainly in a cloud environment.
