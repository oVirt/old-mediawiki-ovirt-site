== VM Payload ==

=== Summary ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
The purpose of the feature is to allow passing a payload to a guest upon startup.

* In progress of defining the requirements


=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
There are many cases in which there is a need to pass a payload to a VM. For example, running windows sysprep, external management of installation of 3rd party products,  etc.
The purpose of the feature is to allow adding such a payload externally, specify the payload method (CD, floppy), specify when this data has to be available,  etc.

The payload options are:
# Availability
#* Permanent payload - payload which will be available in the guest at all times
#* Temporary payload - via "run-once" - will be available only when running the guest via the run-once option
#* No payloads - the VM won't get any payload upon startup/run-once
# Payload passing method
#* Floppy
#* CD
#* In the future also libguestfs injection and payload downloaded via private IP


'''Implementation notes:'''
# '''backend, frontend:''' only one payload per vm
# '''backend, forntend:''' For now we will limit the content of the file to 16K.
# '''backend, frontend:''' add support to run-once
# '''backend, frontend:''' add support to add/edit VM
# '''backend, frontend:''' add GetVmPayloadQuery() (needed because there is no persistence to payload in VmBase)
# '''backend:''' The Modelling of this feature will include OVF schema changes as well
# '''backend:''' payload will be as cdrom/floppy device, if we use payload-cdrom we don't allow regular cdrom
# '''backend:''' add 3 fields to VM class (not persistence) payload_type, payload_filename, payload_content
# '''bacnend:''' payload will be present as a cdrom/floppy device with the payload data in the specParams (and will be persist to db)
# '''backend:''' change cd will be enabled on the payload-cdrom (which will be the only cdrom)
# '''vdsm:''' will parse the device and create temp cdrom/floppy file-system file.
# '''vdsm:''' will remove the payload data when returning the vmStats to backend
# '''vdsm:''' on migration will have the same devices
# '''vdsm:''' on destroy will delete the temp file-system
# '''bacnend:''' the file names should be passed in Unicode
# '''backend:'''The payload data will be encoded using base64 encoding
# '''vdsm:''' should re-encode them as utf8 when writing them to disk

=== API Design ===
This is an example for the API for this feature,
the vm_paload element will work in add/edit VM and for Run-VM actions
 <nowiki>
   <vm>
   ...
     <payloads>
         <payload type='cdrom'>
             <files>
                 <file>
                      <name>my.txt</name>
                      <content>some content</content>
                </file>
             </files>
         </payload>
     </payloads>
  </vm>
 </nowiki>

=== Design Notes ===
vmPayload is passed in the create params:
 <nowiki>
 'vmPayload': { 'cdrom': [{'filename': 'content' }, {'filename': 'content'}],
  'floppy': [{'filename': 'content' }, {'filename': 'content'}],
  'sysprep': {'filename': 'content' },
  'network': '...' }
 </nowiki>

=== User work-flows ===

The Administrator and User Portal should allow the following operations in edit VM:
# Enable/Disable payload
# Once enabled
#* Choose payload method
#** Floppy
#** CD
#* For each payload
#* Choose the path
#* Provide the base64 data

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
The VM payload feature will ease the installation of third party products, mainly in a cloud environment.
