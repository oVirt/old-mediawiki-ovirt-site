=== Summary ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
The purpose of the feature is to allow passing a payload to a guest upon startup.

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
There are many cases in which there is a need to pass a payload to a VM. For example, running windows sysprep, external management of installation of 3rd party products, and etc.
The purpose of the feature is to allow adding such a payload externally, specify the payload method (CD, floppy), specify when this data has to be available, and etc.

The payload options are:
# Availability
#* Permanent payload - payload which will be available in the guest at all times
#* Temporary payload - via "run-once" - will be available only when running the guest via the run-once option
#* No payloads - the VM won't get any payload upon startup/run-once
# Payload passing method
#* Floppy
#* CD
#* In the future also injection and payload via private IP

There are a few options to model that:
# Use current Floppy/CD attachment options:
#* In floppy allow to attach either sysprep or payload
#* In CD allow to attach either an ISO, or a payload
#* There will be a single attachment or payload per device type (floppy, CD)
# Add a payload in addition to the current Floppy/CD attachment options:
#* Add a Payload option, in which you choose whether to pass the payload via CD or floppy (the passing method)
#* In floppy allow to attach a payload
#* In CD allow to attach a payload
#* Both the payload and the attachment are used
#* There may be multiple payloads, and multiple passing options at the same time
#* There will be a single attachment and/or multiple payloads per device type (floppy, CD)
#* In case Windows sysprep is used, we must make sure it gets the first floppy (drive "A:")

After the upstream discussions, the chosen model is the second one.

Notes:
# The payload data will be encoded using base64 encoding.
# All payloads will be passed in the current VDSM create verb
# With either options, the engine API and VDSM API will be general enough to allow adding other passing methods in the future
# The Modelling of this feature will include OVF schema changes as well
# For now we will limit the content of the file to 1024K. In the future we might support using NFS share in cases in which the content is bigger.

=== Design Notes ===
VDSM verb:
 <nowiki>
 { 'iso': [{'filename': 'content' }, {'filename': 'content'}],
  'floppy': [{'filename': 'content' }, {'filename': 'content'}],
  'sysprep': {'filename': 'content' },
  'network': '...' } 
 </nowiki>


=== User work-flows ===

The Administrator and User Portal should allow the following operations in edit VM:
# Enable/Disable payload
# Once enabled
#* Choose payload method
#** Floppy
#** CD
#* For each payload
#* Choose the path
#* Provide the base64 data

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
The VM payload feature will ease the installation of third party products, mainly in a cloud environment.
