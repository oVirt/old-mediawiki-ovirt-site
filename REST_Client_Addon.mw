Two methods for invoking RestAPI requests are described ahead:

Using ''firefox'' rest client add on:

Add to firefox the rest-client add-on: <<BR>>
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/

Once installed and firefox was restarted, go to Tools --> REST Client<<BR>>
Click on Login button, enter username and password.<<BR>>
Username should include the domain. e.g. 
{{{
vdcadmin@qa.lab.tlv.redhat.com
}}}

Select "Get" method<<BR>>
Put in URL field the server address, followed by /api. e.g:
{{{
http://localhost:8080/api/
}}}

Click on send.<<BR>>
The expected result in the bottom window should be a green bar with text:<<BR>>
{{{
ERROR CODE: 200, OK
}}}

On the "Response Body" tab, the entire entities supported by the service are presented.<<BR>>
Selecting a specific entity and sending request for it will return as response the action supported for it and a collection of those entities.<<BR>>
The following link will return the entire list of VMs: <<BR>>
{{{
http://localhost:8080/api/vms
}}} 
The response body contains a fixed list of "ready-to-paste" list which could be used to be pasted into the URL.<<BR>>

If wishes to run command/action: <<BR>>
 1. Change to "Post" method
 1. Add a header by clicking on "+Add Request Header" button:
{{{
name: Content-type
value: application/xml
}}}
 1.#3 Paste in the request body the request

e.g. for adding a snapshot for a specific vm, type a url for that vm:
{{{
http://localhost:8080/api/vms/61d0c568-62f5-4b8c-8548-7000beb27d7c/snapshots
}}}

The request body:
{{{
<snapshot>
<description>New Snapshot for VM</description>
<vm id="61d0c568-62f5-4b8c-8548-7000beb27d7c" href="/api/vms/67f2ba3e-1a32-4aee-8be6-3f5c6fa4cfd8"/>
</snapshot> 
}}}
This will add a new snapshot for VM with id 61d0c568-62f5-4b8c-8548-7000beb27d7c. <<BR>>

== curl ==
The second method is by using ''curl'' utility from the command line. <<BR>>

Example of adding new snapshot:
{{{
curl -v -u "vdcadmin@qa.lab.tlv.redhat.com":123456 \
   -H "Content-type: application/xml" \
   -d '<snapshot>  \
        <description>New Snapshot for VM</description> \
        <vm id="61d0c568-62f5-4b8c-8548-7000beb27d7c" href="/api/vms/61d0c568-62f5-4b8c-8548-7000beb27d7c"/> \
    </snapshot>' \
   'http://localhost:8080/api/vms/61d0c568-62f5-4b8c-8548-7000beb27d7c/snapshots'
}}}
The ''curl'' command line utility could be enhanced by a script which could run in parallel to test various scenarios.<<BR>>
It is also suitable for any type of non-functional tests (NFT). 
For full list of arguments refer to curl man pages.
