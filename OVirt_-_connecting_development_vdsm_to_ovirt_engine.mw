By default OVirt communicates with VDSM with ssl. This is a safe default, but difficult to handle at development and debugging.

== Disable SSL in VDSM ==

* in /etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf [vars] section: ssl = false
* in /etc/libvirt/libvirt.conf: listen_tls=0
* and in /etc/libvirt/quemu.conf: spice_tls=0

After this is done, restart vdsm

== Disable SSL in ovirt engine ==

This works simply by updating oVirt's database:

 psql engine -U postgres -c "UPDATE vdc_options set option_value = 'false' where option_name = 'SSLEnabled'"
 psql engine -U postgres -c "UPDATE vdc_options set option_value = 'false' where option_name = 'UseSecureConnectionWithServers'"

Restart ovirt engine.
