== Network Labels ==

=== Summary ===
Network labels allow to tag networks with a label and to use that label on the host's interface, so the label abstracts the networks from the physical interface:<br>
The host network configuration can be done by manipulating the network label:
* Tagging a network with label will attach that network to all hosts nics which are tagged with that label.
* Removing a tag from the network will trigger its removal from all hosts nics which are tagged with that label.
* Modifying a network will update all hosts nics which are tagged with that label.
