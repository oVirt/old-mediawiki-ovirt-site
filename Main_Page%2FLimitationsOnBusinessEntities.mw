== Coding limitations on Business Entities ==

=== Summary ===
Currently oVirt engine-core and web UI components of oVirt share the same business entities (i.e org.ovirt.engine.core.common.DiskImageBase).
As long as there is no separation of business entities between engine-core and web UI , there are some coding limitations (as a result of GWT compilation) which should be 
addressed by developers defining a new entity.

=== List of limitations ===

* final members should not be used. <BR>

For example:<BR>
Use  int numberOfVms instead of final int numberOfVms<BR><BR><BR>


* Concrete collection classes should be used.<<BR>>

For example:<<BR>>
Use  ArrayList<DiskImage> getImages() instead of List<DiskImage> getImages()<<BR>><<BR>><<BR>>
