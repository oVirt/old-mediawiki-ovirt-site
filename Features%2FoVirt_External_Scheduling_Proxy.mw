=== Detailed Description ===

The external scheduler is a daemon and its purpose is for oVirt users to extend the scheduling process with custom python filters, scoring functions and load balancing functions.
As mentioned above any plugin file {NAME}.py must implement at least one of the functions.
The service will be started by the installer, and the engine will be able to communicate with it using XML-RPC.

* Scheduler conf file (etc/ovirt/scheduler/scheduler.conf), optional (defaults):
 listerning port=# (18781)
 ssl=true/false (true)
 plugins_path=/path ($PYTHONPATH/ovirt_scheduler/plugins)
* Additionally for every python plugin an optional config file can be added (etc/ovirt/scheduler/plugins/{NAME}.conf).
