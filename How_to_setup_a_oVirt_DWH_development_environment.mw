== Prerequisites ==
<b>Please notice:</b> We assume you have set up a development environment according to the steps  available at  [http://www.ovirt.org/OVirt_Engine_Development_Environment OVirt_Engine_Development_Environment] or within source tree at [http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-engine.git;a=blob;f=README.developer;hb=HEAD README.developer] ,
before you start.

== Source ==

Checkout source:
 <nowiki>cd $HOME
$ git clone http://gerrit.ovirt.org/p/ovirt-dwh</nowiki>

== Install Talend DI and import the project ==

* Download and install the latest Talend DI version.
 Available from: http://www.talend.com/download.php 
* Import the oVirt DWH project from the path:
 < repository folder path >/ovirt-dwh/tos_project
* You may now edit the project using the studio. Please refer to the Talend documentation for usage details.

== Setup history database to test with Talend  ==
* setup oVirt Engine.
Note: Postgres is required to create the database.
* Create a new ovirt_engine_history database in postgres.
 create role ovirt_engine_history with login encrypted password 'ovirt_engine_history';
 create database ovirt_engine_history owner ovirt_engine_history  template template0   encoding 'UTF8' lc_collate 'en_US.UTF-8'  lc_ctype 'en_US.UTF-8';

* Create the ovirt_engine_history database schame using the schema.sh script in the path:
 < repository folder path >/ovirt-dwh/packaging/dbscripts/schema.sh -d ovirt_engine_history -c apply -u postgres
* Setup connections context in the Talend DI. For details on this refer to Talend's documentation.
* You may now run the project and test it in the Talend DI.

== Test package deployment  ==
* setup oVirt Engine.
 Note: Postgres is required to create the database.
* Create or Upgrade the ovirt_engine_history database using the schema.sh script in the path (Note: You will first need to create a new database in postgres if it does not already exist):
 < repository folder path >/ovirt-dwh/packaging/dbscripts/schema.sh -d ovirt_engine_history -c apply -u postgres
* Build the required jars in the path :
 < repository folder path >/ovirt-dwh
* Run:
 ant
* You can now run the ovirt-enigne-dwhd service.

== Remove package test deployment  ==
* Drop the ovirt_history database, if you want to reset collection.
* Run the maven undeployment profile:
 mvn clean install -Pundep
* Run the root undeployment script as root in the path:
 < repository folder path >/ovirt-dwh/data-warehouse/history_etl/etl_sources/packaging/root_etl_undeploy.sh
* You may also remove config files in the paths: /etc/ovirt/ovirt-dwh, /etc/logrotate.d/ovirt-etl.
* Everything should now be removed.
