== Prerequisites ==
<b>Please notice:</b> We assume you have set up a development environment according to the steps  available at  [http://www.ovirt.org/OVirt_Engine_Development_Environment OVirt_Engine_Development_Environment] or within source tree at [http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-engine.git;a=blob;f=README.developer;hb=HEAD README.developer] ,
before you start.

== Source ==

Checkout source:
 <nowiki>cd $HOME
$ git clone git://gerrit.ovirt.org/ovirt-dwh</nowiki>

== Usage ==

<font color=red><b>WARNING:</b> DO NOT RUN ENVIRONMENT UNDER ROOT ACCOUNT</font>

Once prerequisites are in place, you are ready to build and use ovirt-engine-dwh.

Build product and install at the same PREFIX used to install ovirt-engine, for example: <code>$HOME/ovirt-engine</code>, the installation into PREFIX is similar to ovirt-engine process, execute:
 <nowiki>$ make install-dev PREFIX="$HOME/ovirt-engine"</nowiki>

Create user and history database 
 su - postgres -c "psql -d template1 -c \"create user ovirt_engine_dwh password 'ovirt_engine_dwh';\""
 su - postgres -c "psql -d template1 -c \"create database ovirt_engine_dwh owner ovirt_engine_dwh template template0 encoding 'UTF8' lc_collate 'en_US.UTF-8' lc_ctype 'en_US.UTF-8';\""

Setup engine again, select yes when prompted to use dwh, and input above database credentials.

When product is successfully set up, follow instruction within the ovirt-engine development environment and start the ovirt-engine service.

Then start the dwh service by the following command:
 <nowiki>$ $HOME/ovirt-engine/share/ovirt-engine-dwh/services/ovirt-engine-dwhd/ovirt-engine-dwhd.py start</nowiki>
The services will not exit as long as engine is up, to stop press <Ctrl>C.
