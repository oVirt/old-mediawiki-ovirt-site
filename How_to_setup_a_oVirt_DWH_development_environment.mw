== Prerequisites ==
<b>Please notice:</b> We assume you have set up a development environment according to the steps  available at  [http://www.ovirt.org/OVirt_Engine_Development_Environment OVirt_Engine_Development_Environment] or within source tree at [http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-engine.git;a=blob;f=README.developer;hb=HEAD README.developer] ,
before you start.

== Source ==

Checkout source:
 <nowiki>cd $HOME
$ git clone git://gerrit.ovirt.org/ovirt-dwh</nowiki>

== Usage ==

<font color=red><b>WARNING:</b> DO NOT RUN ENVIRONMENT UNDER ROOT ACCOUNT</font>

Once prerequisites are in place, you are ready to build and use ovirt-engine-dwh.

Build product and install at <code>$HOME/ovirt-engine</code>, execute the following as unprivileged user while residing within source repository:
 <nowiki>$ make install-dev PREFIX=< Same as engine PREFIX ></nowiki>

Setup product by executing the following command and replying to questions,  follow the steps required for the  ovirt_engine_history database creation :
 <nowiki>$ $HOME/ovirt-engine/bin/engine-setup</nowiki>

If jboss is installed at alternate location, add the following while JBOSS_HOME contains the location: <code>--jboss-home="${JBOSS_HOME}"</code>

When product is successfully set up, execute the ovirt-engine service:
 <nowiki>$ $HOME/ovirt-engine/share/ovirt-engine/services/ovirt-engine/ovirt-engine.py start</nowiki>
and
 <nowiki>$ $HOME/ovirt-engine/share/ovirt-engine-dwh/services/ovirt-engine-dwhd/ovirt-engine-dwhd.py start</nowiki>
The services will not exit as long as engine is up, to stop press <Ctrl>C.

Access your engine using:
* http://localhost:8080
* https://localhost:8443

When performing code change which do not touch modify database, there is no need to re-execute the setup, just execute:
 <nowiki>$ make install-dev PREFIX=< Same as engine PREFIX ></nowiki>

And start the engine service.
