Typically, just another parameter for a network configuration to determine the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit MTU].

=== Code Change ===
# Add MTU : String to network entity
# Add deserialization to MTU field in VdsBrokerObjectsBuilder.java. Serialise as String and not Int.
# DB - add field in to vds_interface and vds_interface_view
# DAO - add field to VdsInterfaceDao CRUD actions

=== Backward Compatibility ===

Same as for bridge-less feature.
