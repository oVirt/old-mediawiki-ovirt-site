=== Code Changes ===

==== Model ====
# Add MTU : String to network entity
# Add deserialization to MTU field in VdsBrokerObjectsBuilder.java. Serialise as String and not Int.
# DB - add field in to vds_interface,vds_interface_view, network,network_view
# DAO - add field to VdsInterfaceDao,networkDao CRUD actions
# DAO - update tests


==== BL ====
#extend non-operational API to accept more reasons 
#remove redundant checking in monitoring code - same check for missing
#add tests for the API refactoring network in CollectVdsNetworkData and VdsManager
#refactor VdsManager to send the host to non-oper on MTU difference with Cluster
# add tests to VdsManager for the new behaviour


=== Backward Compatibility ===

Same as for bridge-less feature.

The XML returned by VDSM may have or miss the element of "mtu" 
since this wasn't reported till now. 

The code must check for existing elements and then try to deserialize 
to interface/bond/network entities. 

Missing element is ignored for its implicitly regarded as non compatible.
