Typically, just another parameter for a network configuration to determine the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit MTU].

=== Code Change ===
# Add MTU : String to network entity
# Add deserialization to MTU field in VdsBrokerObjectsBuilder.java. Serialise as String and not Int.
# DB - add field in to vds_interface and vds_interface_view
# DAO - add field to VdsInterfaceDao CRUD actions

=== Backward Compatibility ===

Same as for bridge-less feature.

The XML returned by VDSM may have or miss the element of "mtu" 
since this wasn't reported till now. 

The code must check for existing elements and then try to deserialize 
to interface/bond/network entities. 

Missing element is ignored for its implicitly regarded as non compatible.
