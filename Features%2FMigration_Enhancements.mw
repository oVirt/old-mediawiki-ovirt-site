== Summary ==
The goal is to improve migration convergence, especially for large VMs.

== Details ==
There are three areas to improve the convergence:
* Expose parameters available on VM level to the cluster level
* Expose some parameters available in VDSM conf to cluster level config
* Change logic on vdsm side

=== Expose Parameters from VM Level to Cluster Level ===
On VM level we already have under the host the:
* Use custom migration downtime (e.g. how long the VM can be down in the last stage of migration)
* Use auto convergence from qemu (detect the lack of convergence and throttle down the guest)
* Use migration compression

=== Expose some parameters available in VDSM conf to cluster level config ===
* Max bandwidth
* Max timeout without convergence + action what if the timeout is reached (abort migration or turn to post-copy mode)

=== Change logic on vdsm side===
* Allocate the bandwidth to the VMs according to the number of running migrations (e.g. if only one, allocate the full bandwidth, if two, allocate 50%/50%)
* If stalling, make downtime more aggressive
