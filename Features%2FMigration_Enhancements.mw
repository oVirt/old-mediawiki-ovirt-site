== Summary ==
The goal is to improve migration convergence, especially for large VMs.

== Details ==
* Bandwidth:
** Expose max bandwidth to the user (per cluster)
** For 1 VM allocate full bandwidth, for 2 VMs allocate 50%-50%
* Stalling
** Make downtime algorithm more aggressive when stalling
** Expose the migration_progress_timeout and let the user to pick action if reached
*** abort
*** switch to post copy mode
** Use auto convergence from qemu
