== Summary ==
The goal is to improve migration convergence, especially for large VMs.

== Details ==
There are three areas to improve the convergence:
* Expose parameters available on VM level to the cluster level
* Expose some parameters available in VDSM conf to cluster level config
* Change logic on vdsm side

=== Expose Parameters from VM Level to Cluster Level ===
On VM level we already have under the host side tab of the edit VM dialog the:
* Use custom migration downtime (e.g. how long the VM can be down in the last stage of migration)
* Use auto convergence from qemu (detect the lack of convergence and throttle down the guest)
* Use migration compression
We should expose this parameters to cluster level

=== Expose some parameters available in VDSM conf to cluster level config ===
* Max bandwidth
* Max timeout without convergence
* Action when max timeout without convergence reached:
** Currently VDSM aborts the migration when the timeout is reached, we should add the support for choose between two actions:
*** Abort (original behavior)
*** Turn to post-copy mode (more risky but guaranteed to converge (or fail))

=== Change logic on vdsm side===
* Allocate the bandwidth to the VMs according to the number of running migrations (e.g. if only one, allocate the full bandwidth, if two, allocate 50%/50%)
* Don't pre-calculate the migration downtime but calculate it as a reaction to stalling. The current algorithm is:
** min_downtime = max_downtime / steps
** base = (max_downtime - min_downtime) ** (1 / (steps - 1))
** current_downtime = min_downtime + base ** current_step
** The current_step is in range from 1 to (steps -1). So the smallest downtime is max_downtime/steps and the biggest is max_downtime. The problem is that this algorithm does not take into account if the remaining memory can be migrated given the current bandwidth in the time of current_downtime. So the change will be to:
*** If the migration progresses, leave the downtime algorithm as is. If it starts stalling, than set the min_downtime = data_remaining / bandwidth_available_for_the_vm. If the data_remaining / bandwidth_available_for_the_vm > max_downtime than the current_downtime == max_downtime. The base ** current_step will than give more time for the migration to progress.

== UI Changes ==
The cluster dialog will contain the Migration Policy part which.

The edit VM dialog will be able to override the following parameters:
* Max time without convergence
* When not converging (abort or turn to post-copy mode)
* Max downtime
* Enable auto convergence
* Enable migrate compression
