== Summary ==
The goal is to improve migration convergence, especially for large VMs.

== Details ==
There are three areas to improve the convergence:
* Expose parameters available on VM level to the cluster level
* Expose some parameters available in VDSM conf to cluster level config
* Change logic on vdsm side

=== Expose Parameters from VM Level to Cluster Level ===
On VM level we already have under the host the:
* Use custom migration downtime (e.g. how long the VM can be down in the last stage of migration)
* Use auto convergence from qemu (detect the lack of convergence and throttle down the guest)
* Use migration compression


* Bandwidth:
** Expose max bandwidth to the user (per cluster)
** For 1 VM allocate full bandwidth, for 2 VMs allocate 50%-50%
* Stalling
** Make downtime algorithm more aggressive when stalling
** Expose the migration_progress_timeout and let the user to pick action if reached
*** abort
*** switch to post copy mode
** Use auto convergence from qemu
** Migration compression
