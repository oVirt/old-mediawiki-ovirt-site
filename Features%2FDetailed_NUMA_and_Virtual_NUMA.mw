== Summary ==
This is the detailed design page for NUMA and Virtual NUMA

You may also refer to the [http://www.ovirt.org/Features/NUMA_and_Virtual_NUMA simple feature page].

== Get Host NUMA topology ==
=== Overview ===
[[File:Get Host NUMA topology.png]]
=== Engine core ===
*A new VDS attribute - numanodes - will be added to support this feature.
**Means a DB change: extend vds_dynamic to add it.
*The attribute will hold a string in a format
**Format: i:c[,c]:tm:fm[;i:c[,c]:tm:fm]
***i: numa node number
***c: cpu inner numa node
***tm: numa node total memory
***fm: numa node free memory
**Examples
***0:0,1:16381:14428 => one numa node 0 has two cpus 0 1, total memory 16381, free memory 14428
***0:0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14:49141:46783;1:1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15:49141:46783 => first numa node 0 has 8 cpus 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14, total memory 49141, free memory 46783; second numa node 1 has 8 cpus 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15, total memory 49141, free memory 46783
*Engine receives the information from VDSM xml-rpc invoke
