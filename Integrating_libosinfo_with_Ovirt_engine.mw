== integrating with libosinfo ==

=== Summary ===
ovirt engine needs OS information out-sourced instead of static DB/code configuration. 
[[libosinfo|https://fedorahosted.org/libosinfo/]] is a GObject based library API for managing information about operating systems, hypervisors and the (virtual) hardware devices they can support. It includes a database containing device metadata and provides APIs to match/identify optimal devices for deploying an operating system on a hypervisor.

=== Benefits for ovirt ===
Use the knowledge supplied by OS providers to set VM default values of CPU and RAM, ISO download links, supported hardware per hypervisor (validation on top of it?).

=== Detailed Description ===

*abstraction for query Os info - OSInfoService
engine will have a service to abstract all interaction with libosinfo.
#the service will encapsulate the means of how to interact with the library itself 
#the service will expose a required subset of libosinfo API
service verbs:
 OSInfoService
 
  /** 
  * Get the recommended minimum memory by OS
  */
  int getRecomendedMemoryByOS(String os)
   
  /**
  * Get the recommended num of CPU by OS
  */
  int getRecommendedCPUByOS(String os)

*interaction detais
libosinfo relies on xml-based db and Gobject bindigs on top with javascript and python api's.
we can either:
#load the xml's to java objects using jaxb. might be a KISS for the current needs. we are loosing the API the library exposes.
#use Java InvokeDynamic to do python or javascript invocation of API. we gain all functionality (bugs too). need to make sure invoking dynamic code is easy and secure - some people reject the idea of leaving the VM for external invocations.
#contribute a java bindings with just a subset of the api - essentially do whats written in 1 and contribute it

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
ovirt should depend on libosinfo RPM which ships with Fedora 17 and RHEL 6.3 <br>
