<!-- {{autolang|base=yes}} -->

=== Summary ===
This wiki provides the basic operational information needed to install, upgrade and maintain the oVirt hosted engine.

=== '''Requirements''' ===
* Two hypervisors (hosts)
* NFS-based shared storage
* Access to the oVirt repository

=== '''Fresh Install''' ===
Assuming you're using ovirt RPMs, you should start with install and deploy:

    # yum install ovirt-hosted-engine-setup
    # hosted-engine --deploy

During the deployment you'll be asked for input on host name, storage path and other relevant information.
The installer will configure the system and run an empty VM.  Access the VM and install an OS:

    [ INFO  ] Creating VM
            ...
            ...
            Please install the OS on the VM.
            When the installation is completed reboot or shutdown the VM: the system will wait until then
            Has the OS installation been completed successfully?

After completing the OS installation on the VM, return to the host and continue. The installer on the host will sync with the VM and ask for the engine to be installed on the new VM:

   [ INFO  ] Creating VM
            ...
            ...
            Please install the engine in the VM, hit enter when finished.

On the VM:
    # yum install ovirt-engine
    # engine-setup

When the engine-setup has completed on the VM, return to the host and complete the configuration. 
Your hosted engine VM is up and running!

'''Notes:'''
* Remember to setup the same hostname you specified as FQDN during deploy while you're setting up the engine on the VM.
* If you want to install ovirt-engine-dwh and ovirt-engine-reports, or update the engine after the deployment is completed, remember that you need to set the system in global maintenance using <br><pre># hosted-engine --set-maintenance=global</pre> because the engine service must be stopped during setup / upgrade operations.

=== '''Migrate existing setup to a VM''' ===
Moving an existing setup into a VM is similar to a fresh install, but instead of running a fresh engine-setup inside the VM,
we restore there a backup of the existing engine. For full details see [[Migrate_to_Hosted_Engine]]

=== '''Installing additional nodes''' ===
Here is an example of a deployment on an additional host:

    # yum install ovirt-hosted-engine-setup
    # hosted-engine --deploy

Once storage path is given, the installer will identify this is an additional host,
and will change the flow accordingly:

    The specified storage location already contains a data domain. Is this an additional host setup (Yes, No)[Yes]? yes
    [ INFO  ] Installing on additional host
            Please specify the Host ID [Must be integer, default: 2]:

As with the first node, this will take you to the process completion.

'''Notes'''
* Remember to use the same storage path you used on first host.

=== '''Maintaining the setup''' ===
The HA services have two maintenance types for different tasks.

==== '''Global maintenance''' ====
Main use is to allow the administrator to start/stop/modify the engine VM without any worry of interference from the HA agents. <br />
In order to maintain the engine VM, use: 

    # hosted-engine --set-maintenance=global

To resume HA functionality, use:

    # hosted-engine --set-maintenance=none

==== '''Local maintenance''' ====
Main use is to allow the administrator to maintain one or more hosts. Note that if you have only 2 nodes and one is in maintenance,<br />
there is only one host available to run the engine VM. The way to maintain a host is by using:

    # hosted-engine --set-maintenance=local

To resume HA functionality, use:

    # hosted-engine --set-maintenance=none

==='''Upgrade Hosted Engine'''===
Assuming you have already installed Hosted Engine on your host and also engine vm have the samve oVirt version

# Set hosted engine maintenance mode to global(now ha agent stop monitoring engine-vm, you can see above how to activate it)
# Enter to engine-vm and upgrade oVirt packages to latest version
# Upgrade hosts with new packages(changes repository to latest version and run yum update -y) on this stage may appear vdsm-tool exception  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1088805
# Restart vdsm(# service vdsmd restart)
# Restart ha-agent and broker services(# service ovirt-ha-broker restart && service ovirt-ha-agent restart)
# Enter for example via UI to engine and change 'Default' cluster(where all your hosted hosts seats) compatibility version to current version (for example 3.4) and activate your hosts(to get features of the new version)
# Change hosted-engine maintenance to none, starting from 3.4 you can do it via UI(right click on engine vm, and 'Disable Global HA Maintenance Mode')
