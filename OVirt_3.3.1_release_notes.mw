{{DISPLAYTITLE:oVirt 3.3.1 release notes}}

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of oVirt 3.3.1 release.

oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization.

To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the [[oVirt 3.3 release notes]], [[oVirt 3.2 release notes]] and [[oVirt 3.1 release notes]].
For a general overview of oVirt, read [[oVirt 3.0 Feature Guide | the oVirt 3.0 feature guide]] and the [[about oVirt]] page.

= Install / Upgrade from previous versions=
== Fedora / CentOS / RHEL ==
If you're installing oVirt 3.3.1 on a clean host you should read our [[Quick Start Guide]]

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.3 you should just execute:
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
 # engine-setup

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.2 you should read [[oVirt 3.2 to 3.3 upgrade]]

If you're upgrading from oVirt 3.1 you should upgrade to 3.2 before upgrading to 3.3.1.
Please read [[oVirt 3.1 to 3.2 upgrade]] before starting the upgrade.<br>
On CentOS and RHEL:
For upgrading to 3.2 you'll need 3.2 stable repository.<br>
So, first step is disable 3.3 / stable repository and enable 3.2 in /etc/yum.repos.d/ovirt.repo:

 [ovirt-32]
 name=Stable builds of the oVirt 3.2 project
 baseurl=http://ovirt.org/releases/3.2/rpm/EL/$releasever/
 enabled=1
 skip_if_unavailable=1
 gpgcheck=0

Then
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
should install  ovirt-engine-setup-3.2.3-1.el6.noarch.rpm<br>
if you have already updated to 3.3.x please use distro-sync or downgrade instead of update.<br>
Then:
 # engine-upgrade
this will upgrade your system to latest 3.2.<br>
Once you've all working on 3.2, enable 3.3/stable repository, then just
 # yum update ovirt-engine-setup
 # engine-setup
will upgrade to latest 3.3.

== Gentoo ==
Experimental Gentoo support for ovirt-engine-3.3.1 is available at https://github.com/alonbl/ovirt-overlay

Instructions on how to install it can be found at http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/OVirt

Feedback is welcomed.

== oVirt Node ==
The updates for oVirt Node can be found [http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/3.3/iso/ here].
Images:
* [http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/3.3/iso/ovirt-node-iso-3.0.3-1.1.vdsm.fc19.iso Fedora 19 based image]

: '''Note:''' Currently there is only an ISO based on Fedora 19. A CentOS based image will follow.
: '''Note:''' An RPM containing the oVirt Node image is also missing, this currently prevents an update through oVirt Engine.

Upgrade instructions can be found on the [[Node_Troubleshooting#Upgrading_oVirt_Node]] page.

= What's New in 3.3.1? =

==Vnic Profiles==
The [[Features/Vnic_Profiles|vnic profiles]] feature was developed as a requirement for the Network QoS feature.
Users can now limit the inbound and outbound network traffic on a virtual NIC level by applying profiles which define custom properties such as port mirroring or quality of service (QoS).

'''Important note:'''

This feature has been identified as an area of specific attention for beta testing.

==Neutron Host Deploy==
It is now possible to specify a Neutron external network provider when
re-installing a host in order to configure it for Neutron networking
(rather than only when deploying a new one).

==Neutron UI Links==
Linking has been added between network providers and their provided
networks; this enables quick navigation from the providers tab where a
provider might be configured to a provided network's main tab view where
most of the management will be performed.

==Add / remove vnics in add/edit VM dialog==
It is now possible to add/remove network interfaces in the add/edit VM
dialog, which enables further customization of a VM's networking
configuration as soon as it's created (complement to Instance Types
feature).

==Manage Storage Connections==
The [[Features/Manage_Storage_Connections|Manage Storage Connections]] adds the ability to add, edit and delete storage connections. This helps supporting configuration changes such as adding paths
(multipathing), changes of hardware, and ease failover to remote sites, by quickly switching to work with another storage that holds a backup/sync of
the contents of the current storage.

==Multiple Monitors==
[[Features/MultipleMonitors|Multiple Monitors]] feature added the ability to channel Spice display protocol up to 4 different PCI channels in a single VM

==oVirt Scheduler==
oVirt now includes a new scheduler to handle VM placement, allowing
users to create new scheduling policies, and also write their own logic in Python and include it in a policy.

The new oVirt scheduler serves VM scheduling requests during VM running or migration.
The scheduling process is done by applying hard constraints and soft constraints to get the optimal host for that request at this point of time.

'''Scheduling policy elements''':

* Filter: a basic logic unit which filters out hypervisors who do not satisfy the hard constraints for placing a given VM.
* Weight function: a function that calculates a score to a given host based on its internal logic. This is a way to implement soft constraints in the scheduling process. Since these are weights, low score is considered to be better.
* Load balancing module: code implementing a logic to distribute the load. So far the definition of load was mostly CPU related, so migrating a VM would help to resolve that. The new scheduler allows users to write their own logic to handle other load types (network, I/O, etc) by other means such as integrating with 3rd party systems.

'''Scheduling process description'''

Every cluster has a scheduling policy. So far we had 3 main policies (None, Even distribution and Power saving),
and now administrators can create their own policies or use he built-in policies. Each policy contains a list of
filters, weight functions (one or more) and a single load balancing module.
The scheduling process takes all relevant hosts and run them through the relevant filters of a specific policy.
Note that Filter order is meaningless.
The filtered host list is then used as an input to the relevant weight functions of that policy, which creates a cost table. The cost table indicates
the host with the lowest weight (cost), which is the optimal solution for the
given request. Multiple Weight functions may be prioritized using a factor.

'''Important note:'''

New scheduling policies created by administrators are not validated by the system. This may end up with unexpected
results, so it is highly important to verify a new policy is not introducing issues or instability to the system.

'''Adding User Code:'''

The infrastructure allowing users to extend the new scheduler, is based on a service called ovirt-scheduler-proxy. The service's purpose is for RHEV
admins to extend the scheduling process with custom python filters, weight functions and load balancing modules.

The daemon is waiting for engine requests using XML-RPC. Engine request may be one of:
* runDiscover: returns an XML containing all available policy units and configurations (configuration is optional).
* runFilters: executes a set of filters plugins sequentially (provided as a name list).
* runScores: executes a set of weight function plugins sequentially (provided as a name list), then calculate a cost table (using factors) and return
it to the engine.
* runBalance: executes the balance plugin named {balance name} on the hosts using the given properties_map.

Any plugin file {NAME}.py the user writes must implement at least one of the functions (do_filter, do_scores, do_balance). These files reside in
$PYTHONPATH/ovirt_scheduler/plugins folder, unless changes in the proxy's configuration file
/etc/ovirt/scheduler/scheduler.conf.
For more information on user code you can check the provided samples.

During the daemon initialization, it will scan this folder to detect user files, and
analyse the files for the relevant functionality. The results are kept in the daemon's
cache, and provided to the engine when the runDiscover is called. Note that the engine will
call it only when it starts up, so in order to introduce a new code, the administrator
needs to restart the proxy service, and then restart the ovirt-engine.

The scheduling proxy is packaged as a separate optional RPM which is not installed by
default. After installing it, the admin needs to allow it in ovirt-engine DB by setting ExternalSchedulerEnabled to True using the configuration utility (engine-config).

'''Important note:'''

Using user provided code may have a performance impact, so administrators are advised to
carefully test their code and the general performance changes before using it in live
setups.

=Known issues=
The Vdsm rebase during ovirt-3.3.1 caused an unintended change in
how gluster storage domains are implemented: Instead of using glusterfs,
it is using gluster-fuse. {{BZ|1022961}}

This change has a positive side effect: {{BZ|1017289}} - "Snapshots on
GlusterFS w/ libgfapi enabled" makes it impossible to use gluster VMs
with snapshots on ovirt-3.3.0; that should be possible now.

If you would like to maintain the former behavior, you can apply a
hackish patch http://gerrit.ovirt.org/21151/ to your Vdsms.
