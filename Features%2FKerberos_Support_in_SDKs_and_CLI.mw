=== Current status ===
Status: implementation

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
* Support isntallations where Kerberos has been selected as the authentication mechanism for the engine.

=== Description ===

==== Python SDK ====
The Kerberos support for the Python SDK will be implemented in two steps:

* Replace the standard HTTP library with pycurl: http://gerrit.ovirt.org/33064
* Add the Kerberos support: http://gerrit.ovirt.org/33221

Once this is implemented the user will be able to specify the use of Kerberos authentication with a new <code>kerberos</code> parameter in the constructor of the <code>API</code> object:

<pre>
 api = ovirtsdk.api.API(
  url="https://ovirt.example.com/ovirt-engine/api",
  kerberos=True,
  ...
 )
</pre>

For this to work the Kerberos client has to be correctly configured (the <code>/etc/krb5.conf</code> file has to exist) and the credentials cache has to be already populated (using the <code>kinit</code> command, for example).
