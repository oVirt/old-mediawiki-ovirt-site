== Storage and Installer Module Rewrite <!-- The name of your feature --> ==

=== Summary ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
The rewritte of the storage and installer module is the last step in rewriting Node's whole python code-base to address limitations and enable unit tests.

=== Current status ===
<!-- * Link to feature page in a specific release. That release may complete the feature, or parts of it. The complete scope of this feature in this release will be described in the release feature page -->
* Status: '''Planning'''
* Last updated: {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}<!--This is markup for current date, do not change-->

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
One generic reason for the rewrite is, that it is not possible to add unit-tests and apply static checks to the existing python code-base. The rewrite of the two modules will address this point.
Furthermore it will be investigated if existing code can be used e.g. for the storage module - e.g. to leverage anaconda's blivet - to enumerate and setup storage devices.
The installer can then be rewritten to use the new storage and (already rewritten) network classes - mainly to simplify the code.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
The overall benefit is to make Node more robust and future proof.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->

* Affected Packages
** ovirt-node


=== Testing ===
TBD

=== Documentation / External references ===
<!-- Is there upstream documentation on this feature, or notes you have written yourself?  Link to that material here so other interested developers can get involved. Links to RFEs. -->
