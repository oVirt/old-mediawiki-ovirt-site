= Host Network Configuration =

Vdsm defines a concept of "host network". These networks are configured by the following Vdsm verbs:
# addNetwork <BR> Add the required Linux networking devices for a new network, as well as the configuration files required to re-create these devices on next boot.
# delNetwork <BR> Delete a previously-added network.
# editNetwork <BR> Replace an existing network definition by a new one.
# setSafeNetConfig <BR> Declare network configuration as "safe", so it persists after host reboot.
# setupNetworks

Currently, host networks are implemented by Linux bridge devices, optionally connected to a vlan devices optionally connected to a bonding device, an optionally goes out of the host via a network interface card.

== Supported network topologies ==
bridge over interface card:
 blue bridge --------------------- nic
bridge over vlan over nic (br and br2 represent two different networks):
 bridge  --- v  ------------- nic
                            /
 bridge2 --- v2 ------------
bridge over bond over several nics:
 bridge ----------- bond --- nic1
                         \
                          -- nic2
(several) bridges over vlans over bond over nics:
 bridge  --- v  --- bond --- nic1
                  /      \
 bridge2 --- v2 --        -- nic2
