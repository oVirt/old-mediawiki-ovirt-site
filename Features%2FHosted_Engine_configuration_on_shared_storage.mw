== Detailed Description ==
* Move the VM configuration from vm.conf to an ovf stored in OVF_STORE image
* Move broker.conf to shared storage (maybe within OVF_STORE image too
* An upgrade path must move the existing configuration to shared storage

== Benefit to oVirt ==
* Will allow to deploy additional hosts from Web UI more easily.
* Will allow to avoid to manually copy configuration changes to all the host in the hosted engine cluster

== Dependencies / Related Features ==
* ovirt-hosted-engine-setup and ovirt-hosted-engine-ha must be adapted to the new configuration location
* ovirt-engine must be adapted to be aware of the OVF_STORE changes
* A tracker bug has been created for tracking issues: {{BZ|1139793}}

== Contingency Plan ==
