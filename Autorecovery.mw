= Autorecovery feature =

This page describes the '''planed''' Autorecovery feature in ovirt engine.

== Behavior ==

* Autorecovery feature will allow the backend to recover some of the objects automatically after a temporary failure. Initially only hosts and storage domains.
* Autorecovery must be enabled for each object. If autorecovery is enabled, the engine will try to recover it forever.
* The recovery logic (at least in the first iteration) will not check if the reason why the object got into Not Operational/Inactive state
* AuditLog will be filled if N automatic recovery unsuccesful.

== Internals ==

* The check will happen in regular intervals (quartz scheduler)
* Needs a DAO extension to fetch only those objects that are in failed state and have auto-recovery on
* It will call the respective commands (ActivateHost, ActivateStorageDomain), and let the commands do what they do
* Database needs to be extended with autorecovery information, default should be false to avoid surprises.
