== Adding NTP Support ==

=== Feature necessity ===
KVM is very sensitive to time issues especially when migrating a VM between 2 hosts with a big time gap.
In a large deployment we need to make sure that the time is synched on all the hosts in the setup.  

=== Feture Description ===
The intent is to use the organization's NTP server to sync time on all the hosts in ovirt setup.
 

=== Assumptions ===
* Organizations will prefer using their own NTP server rather than install a new one for ovirt.
* The NTP server should be configured only once (during ovirt installation), and populated to all hosts through bootstrap and registration.
* Changing the NTP server after installation in not supported - and will require manuall steps to sync it to all the hosts in the setup.
 

=== The feature building blocks ===

===== ovirt-setup =====
* Need to extract NTP server details from user during the installation
* The NTP config should be optional
* Need to update the ntp server in vdc_option table
* Need to configure the ovirt-server ntp to sync with the NTP server

===== DataBase =====    
* Need to add the NTP server configuration to the vdc_options table

===== Engine =====
* Need to utilize this new NTP config (if given) option during bootstrap
* Need to utilize this new NTP config (if given) option during registration/approval
* Need to add support for the optional NTP server in vds_installer.py
 

===== vdsm:bootstrapping =====

===== vdsm:registration =====


=== Optional additions to the feature ===
* vdsm   - to report it's NTP configuration
* engine - handle the vdsm NTP configuration reported by VDSM (save in DB + throw event log if misconfigured) 
* UI     - display the reported NTP configureation 

=== Questions ===
* Should we support more than 1 NTP server ?
* Should we expose this config through the ovirt-config utility ?
