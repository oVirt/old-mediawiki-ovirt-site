== Adding NTP Support ==

=== Feature necessity ===
KVM is very sensitive to time issues especially when migrating a VM between 2 hosts with a big time gap.
In a large deployment we need to make sure that the time is synched on all the hosts in the setup.  

=== Feture Description ===
The intent is to use the organization's NTP server to sync time on all the hosts in ovirt setup. The Info should be obtained from the user during the installation, and pupulated/configured on all the hosts in an ovirt system through bootstrap & registration. 
 

=== Assumptions ===
* Organizations will prefer using their own NTP server rather than install a new one for ovirt.
* The NTP server should be configured only once (during ovirt installation), and populated to all hosts through bootstrap and registration.
* Changing the NTP server after engine installation in not supported - and will require manuall steps to sync it to all the hosts in the setup.
* The NTP server is accesible from all the hosts

=== What needs to be done ===

===== ovirt-setup =====
* Need to extract NTP server details from user during the installation
* The NTP config should be optional
* Need to update the ntp server in vdc_option table
* Need to configure the ovirt-server ntp to sync with the NTP server

===== DataBase =====    
* need to add the NTP server configuration to the vdc_options table

===== Engine:boostrap code =====
* The bootstrap code needs to utilize this new param (if exists) during bootstrapping/upgrading a host
* vds_installer should support this optional param
* the boostrap should also work on ovirt-node

===== Engine:registration =====
* The registration/approval code needs to support this optional param.
* The above should override a previous NTP configuration (done probably through TUI) .
* The registration code should utilize the appropriate ovirt functions.

===== vdsm-bootstrap =====
* Need to add functionality to configure NTP on a host
* This functionality is optional



==== Optional Additional tasks ====
* VDSM to report the configured NTP servers
* Engine to alert on:
 * missmatch in hypervisor's NTP configuration.
 * time diff from ovirt-engine service is greater than X (x = config param ???)
* Add a new ovirt-setup-lugin packae to enable configuring the ovirt-engine server to NTP server.    



=== Questions ===
* Should we support more than 1 NTP server ?  Answer: NTP requires 2 server to work at all and recommends at least 3 NTP servers.
* Should we expose this config through the ovirt-config utility ?
