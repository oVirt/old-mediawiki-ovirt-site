* '''[git-host]''' - The host where the GIT repository you work on is located (your local repo, not origin) - i.e. your lap[top.
* '''[user]''' - The user you use to work on your stuff (In order to clone from your repo).
* '''[git-repo-location]''' - The location of the git repo on the [git-host] - i.e. ~/git/ovirt-engine
