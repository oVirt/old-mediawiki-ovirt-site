== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Provide the details of the feature. What is it going to include. See the sections below. -->
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->
The Quota is a new (searchable) Object in the system, A Quota should contains the following properties:
    1. Name
    2. Description
    3. Data Center which is referenced to.

    4. A list of unlimited number of specific rules, which each rule should specify a resource and resource limitation parameters.
    The limitation is logically separated into different types.
    Each object type has set of rules, according to its type :
    Example for the described list of cluster type:

        [ Cluster1: 6 VCPUs, 9GB RAM - IntelCluster
        Cluster2: 8 VCPUs, 12GB RAM â€“ AmdCluster
        Note that the limitations can be configured for each cluster or a group of clusters.
        For data Quota type object, we will have three different set of rules:
        Unlimited - Indicates on that DC there will be no limitation on data storage,

        Limit per storage - for example:
            Storage Domain1: 20GB
            Storage Domain2: 10GB
            Storage Domain3: 5GB ] 
        Global limitation - Indicates global limitation of storage on that DC (not on specific DS) (example: Global: 100GB) 
    List of Users/Groups that have permission to use the Quota, i.e. assign it to VMs/disks 

Note - Quota should not be supported for 2.2 VM's
