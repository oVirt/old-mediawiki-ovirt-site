== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Provide the details of the feature. What is it going to include. See the sections below. -->
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->

=== Entity Description ===
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->
The Quota is a new (searchable) Object in the system, A Quota contains the following properties:
# Name
# Description
# Data Center which is referenced to.
# List of unlimited number of specific rules, where each rule should specify a resource and resource limitation parameters.
# List of Users/Groups that have permission to use the Quota, i.e. assign it to VMs/disks


For example, the following Quota is configured for R&D:
* ''Name'': DevelQuota
* ''Description'': Quota configured for R&D team
* ''Data Center'': Devel_Data_Center
''VCPU/Memory limitations:''
* Cluster1: 6 VCPUs, 9GB RAM
* Cluster2: 8 VCPUs, 12GB RAM
''Storage Limitations:''
* Storage Domain1: 20GB
* Storage Domain1: 10GB
* Storage Domain3: 50GB
''List of Users/Groups:''
* user1
* group2
<BR>
The resource to limit, can be specific like Cluster or Storage Data, but can also be defined for global resource.<BR>
The global resource defines limitation on the Data Center for a specific type (Storage or Runtime).
Note that run time resources, can be referenced as one entity to limit. (Although for Storage Domains it will not be supported for now).<BR>
<BR>
For example, a Quota object, with global limitation on the cluster and the storage:<BR><BR>
''VCPU/Memory limitations:''
* Global Cluster: 14 VCPUs, 21GB RAM
''Storage Limitations:''
* Global Storage - 80GB
<BR>
A Quota, can be indicated as an unlimited Quota, when it is configured with global resources with no specific limit.<BR>
The following quota is an unlimited Quota:
''VCPU/Memory limitations:''
* Global Cluster: Unlimited
''Storage Limitations:''
* Global Storage - Unlimited

=== CRUD ===
<!-- Describe the create/read/update/delete operations on the entities, and what each operation should do. -->
* Quota can be removed only if there are no entities such as VM or Template, that are referenced to this Quota.
* Quota can be edited; When a Quota is edited, the change should apply to all the entities and users that are assigned to this Quota.
* Quota parameters can be edited, in a way resulting, exceeding the resources limitation (for example, reducing the disk limitation of some storage domain). This case will not result violation. However, once resources will be released to follow the Quota limitation, no user will be able to exceed the Quota resources again.

=== User Experience ===
<!-- Describe user experience related issues. For example: We need a wizard for ...., the behaviour is different in the UI because ....., etc. -->
<!-- GUI mockups should also be added here to make it more clear -->
* the Administrator will be able to create/edit a Quota using a wizard, to configure Cluster Quota parameters, Storage Quota parameters, and Users which will be able to consume those Quota resources.
* For supporting definition of Quota per User, the Quota can be cloned.<BR> Such a clone procedure should copy all the Quota properties except of the name and the description.
* Since the Users assigned to the Quota, would need a power user permission on the Data Center to add/edit a VM, the Administrator should be able to add these permissions automatically, if he desires to. <BR> This automatic assignment, should only be affective when adding resources for limitation; <BR>When reducing resources for limitation, an alert message will be presented as follow: <BR> ''Attention, Quota resources have been changed. Please update the Quota Users permissions on the following resources if needed'' .<BR>Note, that the User, created a Quota, would not necessarily, have permissions, to create/edit entities for using it.

=== Installation/Upgrade ===
<!-- Describe how the feature will effect new installation or existing one. -->
* Upon upgrade or new installation, each Data Center should be assigned with unlimited Quota.
* For each Data Center, all objects (disks and VM's) in the DC will be assigned to this unlimited Quota, and all the users in the setup will be assigned to it as well.
* The new/upgraded DC will be set with the default mode, which is the disabled mode (which means it won't be subjected to the quota restrictions.)
* When the Administrator choose to use quota, he should change the DC quota mode to audit or enforce(see [[CategoryRhev31/PRDs/Quota#DC_quota_mode|DC Quota Enforcement]])
* After the Administrator configure the new quotas he desires for the DC, and assign all the objects and users to the new quotas, he should remove permissions from the unlimited quota to avoid users consuming resources for it.

=== User work-flows ===
<!-- Describe the high-level work-flows relevant to this feature. -->
The Administrator Portal should allow the following operations:
* View/edit/create Quota's
* View/edit /create the User's roles and Quotas
* View Quota per resource (User/Storage domain etc.)
The Power User Portal should allow the following operations:
* View Quota's defined/used for himself
