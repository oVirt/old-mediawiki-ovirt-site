== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Provide the details of the feature. What is it going to include. See the sections below. -->
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->

=== Entity Description ===
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->
The Quota is a new (searchable) Object in the system, A Quota contains the following properties:
# Name
# Description
# Data Center which is referenced to.
# List of unlimited number of specific rules, where each rule should specify a resource and resource limitation parameters.
# List of Users/Groups that have permission to use the Quota, i.e. assign it to VMs/disks


For example, Quota object configured for R&D team, with the following properties:
* Name: DevelQuota
* Description: Quota configured for R&D team
* Data Center: Devel_Data_Center
''VCPU/Memory limitations:''
* Cluster1: 6 VCPUs, 9GB RAM
* Cluster2: 8 VCPUs, 12GB RAM
''Storage Limitations:''
* Storage Domain1: 20GB
* Storage Domain1: 10GB
* Storage Domain3: 50GB
''List of Users/Groups:''
* user1
* group2
<BR><BR>
The resource to limit, can be specific like Cluster or Storage Data, but can also be defined for global resource.<BR>
The global resource defines limitation on the Data Center for a specific type (Storage or Runtime).<BR>
Note that run time resources, can be referenced as one entity to limit. (Although for Storage Domains it will not be supported for now).<BR>
<BR>
For example, a Quota object, with global limitation on the cluster and the storage:<BR><BR>
''VCPU/Memory limitations:''
* Global Cluster: 14 VCPUs, 21GB RAM
''Storage Limitations:''
* Global Storage - 80GB

=== CRUD ===
<!-- Describe the create/read/update/delete operations on the entities, and what each operation should do. -->
Quota can be removed only if there are no VMs/Templates that are pointing to this quota.
Quota can be edited; When a Quota is edited, the change should apply to all the users that have this quota.
Quota parameters can be edited in a way resulting in exceeding it (for example, reducing the disk limitation of some storage domain). This case will not result in a violation. However, once resources will be released to follow the Quota limitation, the user won't be able to exceed the Quota again.

the Administrator will be able to create/edit a quota using a wizard, to configure cluster quota parameters, storage quota parameters, and users which will be able to consume those quota resources.

=== User Experience ===
<!-- Describe user experience related issues. For example: We need a wizard for ...., the behaviour is different in the UI because ....., etc. -->
<!-- GUI mockups should also be added here to make it more clear -->
User can use more than one Quota
Quota should not be defined per user, to support definition of Quota per user, the quota can be cloned.<BR>
Such a clone procedure should copy all the quota properties except of the name and the description.<BR>
Since the users added to the Quota would need a permission of power user on the DC to add/edit a VM, the Administrator can choose whether to add these permissions automatically.<BR>
The automatic assignment would only be affective when adding a limitation on a resource new to the Quota; When removing resources from the Quota, an alert message will be presented.<BR>
Note that the user that created the Quota would not necessarily have the permissions to create/edit resources that use it. <BR>

The Administrator Portal should allow the following operations:

    View/edit/create Quota's
    View/edit /create the User's roles and Quotas
    View Quota per resource (User/Storage domain etc.)
    The Power User Portal should allow the following operations:
    View Quota's defined/used for himself
