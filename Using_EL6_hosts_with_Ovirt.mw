How to use EL6 based hosts with Ovirt-Engine 3.1+

== Assupmtions and Prerequisities ==
* An installed and running instance of ovirt-engine See: [[Installing_ovirt-engine_from_rpm]]
* A system or VM loaded with some flavor of EL6 EG: RHEL, CentOS, SL, OEL (Best practice is to use the one you intend to use for the node)
** At minimum the following from the Development package group should be installed:
*** Development tools
*** Additional Development
*** Server Platform Development
* An active webserver to host a package repository and the kickstart (EG: An EL6 or Fedora box with httpd loaded and running)

== Building the Needed Packages ==

* Some packages need to be built which will work with and are needed for VDSM
* Some of these packages are not yet in EL6 or out of date for what upstream VDSM requires
* Tend to stick with newer versions to match upstream VDSM

=== Building logrotate ===

* Start by pulling the latest logrotate source rpm from the Fedora 17 stable or updates repositories (use the newest)  
* Optionally if you don't mind living on the edge a bit you can pull the newest logrotate source RPM from the Rawhide repositories
* PackageName: logrotate-<version>.fc<releasever>.src.rpm
* The following packages are BuildRequires for logrotate
** libselinux-devel
** popt-devel
** libacl-devel
* To build logrotate:
  rpmbuild --rebuild logrotate-<version>.fc<releasever>.src.rpm
* Resulting RPMS:
** logrotate-<version>.el6.x86_64.rpm
** logrotate-debuginfo-<version>.el6.x86_64.rpm

=== Building sanlock ===
* Start by pulling the latest sanlock source rpm from the Fedora 17 stable or updates repositories (use the newest)  
* Optionally if you don't mind living on the edge a bit you can pull the newest sanlock source RPM from the Rawhide repositories
* PackageName: sanlock-<version>.fc<releasever>.src.rpm
* The following packages are BuildRequires for sanlock
** libblkid-devel
** libaio-devel
** python python-devel
* To build logrotate:
  rpmbuild --rebuild sanlock-<version>.fc<releasever>.src.rpm
* Resulting RPMS:
** sanlock-<version>.el6.x86_64.rpm
** sanlock-debuginfo-<version>.el6.x86_64.rpm
** sanlock-devel-<version>.el6.x86_64.rpm
** sanlock-lib-<version>.el6.x86_64.rpm
** sanlock-python-<version>.el6.x86_64.rpm
