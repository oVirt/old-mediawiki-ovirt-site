= Ideas for backend clustering=

== Problems of backend clustering ==

Backend stored caches some data in local instances. These instances never actually refresh from the background, so with the traditional JEE clustering, it would not work correctly.

== JEE clustering ==

One solution could be to remove the local caches and in-memory data. I don't know if anyone has an estimation for how much work it would take.
* Cache-like hashmaps could be replaced with distributed caches like ehcache or infinispan.
* Local data, like counters should be replaced either to database or infinispan.
* quartz can be easily configured to use JDBC-jobstore, and in that way it is clusterable

== Terracotta? ==

Could all this work be saved with a terracotta configuration?
* Support?
* How should users configure this?
* Deployment complexity?
