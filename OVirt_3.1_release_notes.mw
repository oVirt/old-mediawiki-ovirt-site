The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of its second formal release, oVirt 3.2. The oVirt 3.2 release includes the following notable changes.

= Installer =

* The installation script now supports the configuration of a HTTP/HTTPS proxy, allowing the oVirt Engine to be accessed via port 80 for HTTP, and port 443 for HTTPS ([[Features/OvirtEnginePort80]]).
* The oVirt Engine now supports the use of a remote PostgreSQL database server, specified during installation ([[Features/RemoteDB]]). 
* An 'all-in-one' proof of concept mode is now available. This allows a single machine to both run the management engine and act as a virtualization host ([[Feature/AllInOne]]).

= Tools =

* The Log Collector (engine-log-collector), ISO Uploader (engine-iso-uploader), and Image Uploader (engine-image-uploader) have been rebased to access the oVirt Engine using the new Python SDK. Previously these tools, written in Python, accessed the REST API directly.

= Infrastructure =

* Support has been added for Red Hat Directory Server and IBM Tivoli Directory Server.
* An additional tab has been added to the oVirt Engine's management interface to support monitoring the status of tasks.
* A correlation identifier to support debugging is now used to track events across the user interfaces, engine backend, and VDSM. 
* The oVirt Engine now automatically attempts to auto-activate hosts detected as non-operational.

= User Interface =

* Infrastructure supporting localization has been added, with translations to follow in a later release.
* Infrastructure supporting integration of reports functionality has been added to the oVirt Engine management interface.
