The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of its second formal release, oVirt 3.1.

= What's New? =

The oVirt 3.1 release includes these notable changes.

== Installer ==

* The installation script now supports the configuration of a HTTP/HTTPS proxy, allowing the oVirt Engine to be accessed via port 80 for HTTP, and port 443 for HTTPS ([[Features/OvirtEnginePort80]]).
* The oVirt Engine now supports the use of a remote PostgreSQL database server, specified during installation ([[Features/RemoteDB]]). 
* An 'all-in-one' proof of concept mode is now available. This allows a single machine to both run the management engine and act as a virtualization host ([[Feature/AllInOne]]).

== Tools ==

* The Log Collector (engine-log-collector), ISO Uploader (engine-iso-uploader), and Image Uploader (engine-image-uploader) have been rebased to access the oVirt Engine using the new Python SDK. Previously these tools, written in Python, accessed the REST API directly.

== Infrastructure ==

* Support has been added for Red Hat Directory Server and IBM Tivoli Directory Server.
* An additional tab has been added to the oVirt Engine's management interface to support monitoring the status of tasks.
* A correlation identifier to support debugging is now used to track events across the user interfaces, engine backend, and VDSM. 
* The oVirt Engine now automatically attempts to auto-activate hosts detected as non-operational.

== User Interface ==

* Infrastructure supporting localization has been added, with translations to follow in a later release.
* Infrastructure supporting integration of reports functionality has been added to the oVirt Engine management interface.

== Storage ==

* hot plug disk
* multiple storage domains
* shared disk
* external disk (direct lun)
* posix fs storage domains
* nfs options
* nfs v4
* live snapshot
* disks main tab ("floating disks")
* spm priority
* auto re-activate storage domains from error mode
* '''use sanlock for pool locks (need to see if made ovirt 3.1)'''

== Virtualization ==

* ''Previously it was not possible to import a Virtual Machine or Template that had already been imported, even if it was to a different data center. This has now been fixed ([[Features/ImportMoreThanOnce]]). ''
* Devices in guest virtual machines now retain the same address allocations as other devices are added and/or removed from the guest's configuration ([[Features/Design/DetailedStableDeviceAddresses]]).
* Added support for "pre-started" virtual machine pools. Instead of having to wait for a virtual machine allocated from the pool to boot user's will instead, where possible, be allocated a virtual machine which has already been started ([[Features/PrestartedVm]]).
* Added support for a virtual machine payload, in the form of a Floppy or CD/DVD image, that will be passed to the virtual machine. Virtual machine payloads may be either temporary or permenant.([[Features/VMPayload]]).
* '''native spice usb support (need to see if made ovirt 3.1)'''
* '''spice wan options (need to see if made ovirt 3.1)'''
* new custom hook in vdsm: set vm ticket
* cancel live migration
* Added support for cloning a Virtual Machine from a specific Snapshot ([[Features/CloneVmFromSnapshot]]).
* '''new cpu models: sandy bridge and opteron G4 (need to see if made ovirt 3.1)'''
* '''vnc details screen (need to see if made ovirt 3.1)'''

== SLA ==

* Added support for the definition quotas restricting user resource usage ([[Features/Quota]]).
* Added support for pinning Virtual Machines to specific physical CPUs ([[Features/Design/cpu-pinning]]).

== Network ==

* A new network setup API to support complex network provisioning tasks has been added to the backend, as a result the user interface for host network setup has also been redesigned  ([[Features/Design/Network/SetupNetworks]]).
* It is now possible to adjust the MTU of a logical network, when it is not attached to a cluster ([[Features/Design/Network/Jumbo_frames]]).
* It is now possible to create bridgeless logical networks, previously all logical network were represented using a bridge ([[Features/Design/Network/Bridgeless_Networks]]).
* Hot plugging and unplugging of virtual Network Interface Cards from virtual machines is now supported ([[Features/HotplugNic]]).
* Support for port mirroring, allowing all network traffic to be mirrored to a specific virtual machine, has been added ([[Features/PortMirroring]]).
* Previously, all logical networks were considered mandatroy for all hosts in a cluster. Hosts that were not attached to all logcal networks in the cluster were marked non-responsive. Administrators now have the option to mark specific logical networks as non-mandatory, bypassing this behavior ([[Features/Design/Network/Required_Networks]]).

== Interfaces ==

* New Python SDK, packaged as ''ovirtsdk'' ([[SDK]]).
* New Python CLI, packaged as ''???'' ([[CLI]]).
* Added JSON support for REST API.
* Added session support to the REST API, allowing one login to process multiple requests.
