as well as the dwh setup according to the steps  available at  [http://www.ovirt.org/index.php?title=How_to_setup_a_oVirt_DWH_development_environment How_to_setup_a_oVirt_DWH_development_environment] before you start.

Once prerequisites are in place, you are ready to build and use ovirt-engine-reports.

Build product and install at the same PREFIX used to install ovirt-engine, for example: <code>$HOME/ovirt-engine</code>, the installation into PREFIX is similar to ovirt-engine process, execute:
 <nowiki>$ make install-dev PREFIX="$HOME/ovirt-engine"</nowiki>

Setup engine again, select yes when prompted to use reports.

When product is successfully set up, follow instruction within the ovirt-engine development environment and start the ovirt-engine service, and follow dwh instructions and start dwh service.

Start the reports service by the following command:
 <nowiki>$ $HOME/ovirt-engine/share/ovirt-engine-dwh/services/ovirt-engine-reportsd/ovirt-engine-reportsd.py start</nowiki>

The server can now be run and accessed in the link:
* http://localhost:8080/jasperserver/
with the following credentials:
 User: admin
