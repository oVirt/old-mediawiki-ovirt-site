== Smartcard Support ==

=== Summary ===

* Support pass through of Smartcard attached to client to a virtual machine
* Allow the VM owner or administrator to specify if a virtual machine should support smartcard
* Allow the VM user (on portal) to be able to disable this setting.
* Support configuring this option via web admin, Power user portal, REST API and CLI

=== Current status ===
Pending review:
* VDSM: http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/8450/
* Engine + Webadmin/Power User Portal: http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/8484/
* REST API: http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/8512/

=== Requirements ===

Should be supported on ActiveX and Linux/XPI client


* on client
** spice-xpi-2.7-20 or higher
** console type spice
** does not work with spice-activex-win browser plugin 
* on guest
** coolkey-1.1.0-20.el6 or higher
** esc-1.1.0-24.el6_2.2 or higher

=== Detailed Description ===

==== Webadmin/Power User Portal ====

Affected dialogs:
* new/edit VM dialog
* new/edit Pool dialog
* edit template dialog contains in console

Changes:
* on all of this dialogs in console side tab a new checkbox with label "Smartcard enabled" has been added.

Behavior:
* this checkbox is enabled only for the Spice client, it is visible but disabled for VNC.
* if the checkbox is checked and the user starts a VM, engine sends the ''smartcardEnable'' as true to the VDSM (please refer to the VDSM part of this document for it's meaning)
* if the checkbox is checked (e.g. smartcard is enabled) and the user clicks the console button (e.g. connects to guest), the application sets the ''Smartcard'' property on the spice-xpi plugin to true which has the same effect than calling the ''spicec --smartcard''
** Should also be supported for ActiveX
* Within the user portal the end user should have the option to override this setting and _not_ pass the enable smart card option to the spice client
** Note the should only be able to disable this option
* The user portal should provide a visual indication that the smart card will be enabled


==== REST API ====
* the ''display'' now contains a new optional property ''smartcard_enabled''.
* if not set, the default value is false
* example of creating a VM with smartcard enabled:

 <nowiki>
<vm>
    <name>vm2</name>
    <description>Virtual Machine 2</description>
    <type>desktop</type>
    <memory>536870912</memory>
    <cluster>
        <name>Default</name>
    </cluster>
    <template>
        <name>Blank</name>
    </template>
    <os>
      <boot dev="hd"/>
    </os>
    <display>
        <smartcard_enabled>true</smartcard_enabled>
    </display>
</vm>
 </nowiki>

==== VDSM ====
* When VDSM receives an argument ''smartcardEnable'' with value true it adds to the libvirt configuration to the ''devices'' part the following
 <nowiki>
<smartcard mode="passthrough" type="spicevmc"/>
 </nowiki>

* Example of creating a VM using vdsClient with smartcard support turned on:
 <nowiki>
vdsClient 0 create /dev/null vmId=`uuidgen` macAddr=00:11:22:33:44:55 display=qxl memSize=256 smartcardEnable=true
 </nowiki>
