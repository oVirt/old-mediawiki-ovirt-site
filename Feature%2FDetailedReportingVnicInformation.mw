== Reporting vNIC information reported by Guest Agent Detailed Design ==

=== Summary ===
The Guest Agent reports the vNic details:
* IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6).
* vNic internal name 
[[http://wiki.ovirt.org/wiki/Feature/ReportingVnicImplementation Reporting vNIC implementation reported by Guest Agent Feature Page]]

=== Current status ===
* Target Release: 3.2
* Status: Design
* Last updated date: Nov 12 2012

=== Detailed Description ===
The internal vNic implementation details are reported by VDSM by verbs ''getVmStats'' and ''getAllVmStats''.
    netIfaces = [{'name': 'eth8', 'inet6': ['fe80::21a:4aff:fe16:1ac'], 'inet': ['10.35.17.36'], 'hw': '00:1a:4a:16:01:ac'}, 
                 {'name': 'eth9', 'inet6': ['fe80::21a:4aff:fe16:160','fe80::21a:4aff:fe16:161'], 'inet': ['10.35.1.254'], 'hw': '00:1a:4a:16:01:60'}, 
                 {'name': 'eth7', 'inet6': ['fe80::21a:4aff:fe16:1af'], 'inet': ['10.35.18.69'], 'hw': '00:1a:4a:16:01:af'}]

The vNic device data from the guest contains interface name, IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses and MAC Address.

==== Engine ====

<span style="color:Teal">'''VM_GUEST_AGENT_INTERFACE'''</span> a new satellite table of vm, contains the vNic configuration reported by the guest agent<BR>
{|class="wikitable sortable"
!border="1"| Column Name ||Column Type ||Null? / Default ||Definition 
|-
|vm_id ||UUID ||not null ||The VM's ID 
|-
|interface_name ||VARCHAR(50) ||null ||The vNic's name within the VM 
|-
|mac_address ||VARCHAR(59) ||null ||The vNic's MAC address within the VM 
|-
|ipv4_addresses ||text ||null ||The vNic's IPv4 addresses 
|-
|ipv6_addresses ||text ||null ||The vNic's IPv6 addresses 
|-
|}

The IP addresses columns might contain multiple addresses per vNic and will be stored concatenated by comma.<BR>
The table will be updated only when a change is detected by the reported data from VDSM.

<span style="color:Teal">'''VmGuestAgentInterface'''</span> a new class for representing the data reported by the guest agent:
   Guid vmId - VM's ID
   String name - the internal nic's name
   String macAddress - the internal nic's macAddress
   List<String> ipv4Addresses - the vNic's IPv4 addresses
   List<String> ipv6Addresses - the vNic's IPv6 addresses

<span style="color:Teal">'''VmGuestAgentInterfaceDao'''</span> new DAO will serve as the interface of the VmGuestAgentInterface entity database related actions.
VmGuestAgentInterface is stored to the database only as part of refresh VMs.

==== Engine Flows ====
<span style="color:Teal">'''GetVmGuestAgentInterfaceForVmQuery'''</span> - A query to return the vNic's data for a specific vm by the VM's ID.<BR>

<span style="color:Teal">'''VdsUpdateRunTimeInfo.refreshVms'''</span> - will refresh the vnic's data (as an optimization only if the data was changed). Update should be performed as a mass-operation.

==== VDSM API ====
No changes for VDSM API.

==== Upgrade DB ====
# Add the new table '''VM_GUEST_AGENT_INTERFACE''' and related stored-procedure for save/update/delete/get.
