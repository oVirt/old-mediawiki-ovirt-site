=== Detailed Description ===

A user in the CLI, with no GUI (X server or otherwise) is able to administer every aspect of oVirt, but is unable to open VMs' consoles, because that would require a graphical VNC or Spice window. the logical way to provide VM console access in GUI mode is to provide access to VMs' serial console.


==== User Experience ====
The user should be able to run a command, specifying a VM, and will have a VM's serial console opened in the shell he is working in.
