==Gluster Host Disk Management==
  
{{Feature|name=Gluster Host Disk Management| modules=Engine  | version=3.6|status=Inception }}

== Summary ==
Disk Management feature was the long time awaited feature for Gluster in Ovirt. This helps the admin to provision the storage directly from Ovirt Web admin portal  instead of going to the node and do all the stuffs manually. This feature enables to configure disk and storage devices in host. On Gluster cluster, this helps to identify bricks. The configuration includes

# identify disk and storage devices those are not having file system.
# create new brick by creating new Linux logical volume or expand existing brick by exapnding Linux logical volume used for the brick with those devices.
# format the logical volume with xfs or selected file system if necessary.
# update fstab entry for the logical volume.
# mount the logical volume.

This document describes the design of Disk Management feature for Gluster in Ovirt.
