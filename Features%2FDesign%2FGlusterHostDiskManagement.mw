==Gluster Host Disk Management==
  
{{Feature|name=Gluster Host Disk Management| modules=Engine  | version=3.6|status=Inception }}

== Summary ==
Disk Management feature was the long time awaited feature for Gluster in Ovirt. This helps the admin to provision the storage directly from Ovirt Web admin portal  instead of going to the node and do all the stuffs manually. This feature enables to configure disk and storage devices in host. On Gluster cluster, this helps to identify bricks. The configuration includes

# identify disk and storage devices those are not having file system.
# create new brick by creating new Linux logical volume or expand existing brick by exapnding Linux logical volume used for the brick with those devices.
# format the logical volume with xfs or selected file system if necessary.
# update fstab entry for the logical volume.
# mount the logical volume.

This document describes the design of Disk Management feature for Gluster in Ovirt.

=== New Entities ===

==== StorageDevice ====
This entity helps to store the details of a storage device in the host. A host will nave multiple instance of this storage device to represent the storage devices in the host.
{| class="wikitable"
|+ StorageDevice
!Column name !! Type !! Description
|-
| id || UUID || Id  generated by engine (Primary Key)
|-
| devUuid || String || Dev UUID Given by the system to device
|-
| vds_id || UUID || Host ID  (Foreign Key to Host). 
|-
| name || String || Name of the device
|-
| model || String || Description about the device
|-
| devpath || String || Device Path
|-
|mountPoint || String || Mount Point
|-
| fsType || String || File system type 
|-
| fsUuid || String || UUID for the file system in the device. 
|-
| isFree || boolean || Is device is already used or its free for usage.
|}

=== Sync Job ===
Information about the storage devices in the host will be fetched periodically and stored in the DB  by a sync job. This sync job will run for once in 24 hours. There will be an option in the UI to force sync the storage device details.

=== BLL commands ===
* <big>CreateBrick</big> - creates a logical volume with the given set of storage devices and format it with XFS file system and mounts the LV at a pre configured path. 
* <big>ExtendBrick</big> - Add the selected block devices to the given LV to increase the storage space available in the LV.
* <big>SyncStorageDevices</big> - Force sync the storage devices from host.

=== Engine Queries ===
* <big>GetStorageDevices</big> - lists all the Storage Devices available in the Host
* <big>HostGetUnusedBricksQuery</big> - lists all the Unused LVs in the Host.

=== VDSM Verbs ===
==== VDSM verbs for Disk Provisioning====
* <big>GlusterStorageDevicesList</big> -  Returns all the storage devices in the host
<TODO: explain verb's parameters and return structure>

* <big>GlusterBrickCreate</big> -  Create an LV which can be to create gluster volume
<TODO: explain verb's parameters and return structure>

* <big>GlusterBrickExpand</big> -  Expand the given LV by adding the selected disk
<TODO: explain verb's parameters and return structure>


=== REST APIs ===
The details of the REST APIs for Disk Provisioning feature are as below -

==== storagedevices sub-collection of the host resource ====
* A collection of storage devices that are attached to a specific host:
   /api/hosts/{host:id}/storagedevices
* Supported actions:
*# '''GET''' returns a list of storage devices attached to the host

==== storagedevice resource under host====
 /api/hosts/{host:id}/storagedevices/{storagedeviceuuid}
* Supported actions:
*# '''GET''' returns the details about the given storage device by uuid

====Create Gluster Brick of the Host resource ====
*An action to create gluster brick
 /api/hosts/{host:id}/createbrick
* Supported actions:
** '''POST''' - executes CreateBrick action on the host

====Extend Gluster Brick of the Host resource ====
*An action to extand the given gluster  brick
 /api/hosts/{host:id}/storagedevices/{storagedeviceuuid}/extendbrick
* Supported actions:
** '''POST''' - executes ExtendBrick action on the given storage device
