=== Summary ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
This utility is intended to bring the host to a state it can be reused by oVirt engine

=== Present ===
(To be replaced to a link when a design page is created)

 * Drop DB - works both on local and remote
 * Remove keystore (not perfect)
 * cleanup symlinks
 * stop services (jbossas, notifer)
 * non-interactive switch -u/--unattended, default is drop DB.
 * switch: -d/--dont-drop-db

=== Absent ===
Missing to comply with the purpose definition:
----------------------------------------------
 * Default mode is interactive - asking if to drop DB or not.
   Message: Drop data base? if you want to reuse the existing database for the future installation choose no.
 * Message at the end: Finished cleanup it is now safe to rerun engine-setup.
 * If it did not dropped DB add: Note that after re-install you'll have to run Hosts re-install/re-approve
 * Add -h/--help
 * Add message (Hide all options except -d/-u/-h in the usage message/help)

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
The cleanup should provide:

1. Reset a failed installation to a state in which you can safely rerun: engine-setup 

2. Clean up before a new installation before or after the user has run:
 # yum remove
and the later tries it a second time without a formal clean-up being performed

- Meaning the sequence I (first example) :  
 # engine-cleanup
 # yum remove ovirt-engine
 # yum install ovirt-engine
 # engine-setup 

- Or the sequence II     (second example): 
 # yum remove ovirt-engine,
 # yum install ovirt-engine
 # engine-cleanup
 #  engine-setup

- If sequence II is not possible, don't start cleanup at all, but exit with proper message. 

3. Reset an existing installation without dropping DB. 

- Use cases: fix failed upgrade or a corrupted installation

- Next required 'Manual' steps: 
 # yum remove engine
 # yum install engine
 # engine-setup   # This script should know how to reuse an existing DB, and to perform an upgrade if necessary
 
Note 1: The above includes Reports and DHW

Note 2. This utility is not intended to leave the machine clean for other application to reuse - only to be reused by a oVirt Manager

Note 3: Preserve DB is not intended to relocate db from local to remote and vice versa - Need to provide a procedure to do that.

Note 4: It will not remove any local NFS export, including the one it created during last installation. If we wish for engine-setup to reuse, this is enhancement to for engine-setup.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
This feature saved the need to re-install the host OS if a re-install of the engine is required. Currently in some cases even an initial installation failure may require clean install 


=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->




=== Documentation / External references ===
<!-- Is there upstream documentation on this feature, or notes you have written yourself?  Link to that material here so other interested developers can get involved. Links to RFEs. -->

The clean-up script should be idempotent.  If not, it needs a bug filed noting the deficiency.  That is, one should be able to repeatedly run:

 # engine-cleanup
 # engine-cleanup
 # engine-cleanup # ... 

with no additional changes occurring on the second and following runs, beyond what occurred on the first, and supplementation of the log files
