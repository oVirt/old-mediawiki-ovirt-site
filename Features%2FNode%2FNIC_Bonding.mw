== NIC Bonding <!-- The name of your feature --> ==

=== Summary ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
This feature will allow Node to create NIC bonds, either through the UI or using kernel arguments.

=== Current status ===
<!-- * Link to feature page in a specific release. That release may complete the feature, or parts of it. The complete scope of this feature in this release will be described in the release feature page -->
* Status: '''In Progress'''
* Last updated: {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}<!--This is markup for current date, do not change-->

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
Node will honors dracut's bonding syntax and will create (and persist) bonds accordingly.
The syntax is:
<pre>
bond=<bondname>[:<bondslaves>:[:<options>]]
</pre>

This syntax will be represented in three new config keys:
<pre>
OVIRT_BOND_NAME
OVIRT_BOND_SLAVES
OVIRT_BOND_OPTIONS
</pre>
The created bond device can then be modified like any other device (e.g. a VLAN can be assigned)


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
Just another step in offering some enhanced networking stuff in Node.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->

* Affected Packages
** ovirt-node
** vdsm (possibly)


=== Testing ===
Cover all methods for creating and removing bonds.
