=== Current status ===
* Last updated date: Wed July 20 2012

== Detailed description ==

=== Behavior ===

* Autorecovery feature allows the backend to recover some of the objects automatically after a temporary failure. Only automatic recovery of hosts and storage domains are supported.
* Autorecovery can be enabled/disabled for each object of the above entity types. The engine tries to recover it periodically as long as the autorecovery is set to true.
* The recovery logic does not check the reason why the object got into Not Operational/Inactive state
* AuditLog is limited to be issued once every 3 hours for unsuccessful recovery.

=== Internals ===

* The check happens in regular intervals (quartz scheduler)
* Needs a DAO extension to fetch only those objects that are in failed state and have auto-recovery on
* It calls the respective commands (ActivateHost, ActivateStorageDomain), and let the commands do what they do
* Database is extended with autorecovery information, default is true - as discussed on engine-devel list. As of now, this property is always true for each autorecoverable entity and can not be changed through engine.
