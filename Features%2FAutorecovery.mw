=== Summary ===

=== Current status ===
* Last updated date: Wed Feb 08 2012

== Detailed description ==

=== Behavior ===

* Autorecovery feature will allow the backend to recover some of the objects automatically after a temporary failure. Initially only hosts and storage domains entities will support this feature.
* Autorecovery can be enabled for each object of the above entity types. The engine will try to recover it periodically as long as the autorecovery is set to true.
* The recovery logic (at least in the first iteration) will not check the reason why the object got into Not Operational/Inactive state
* AuditLog will be limited to be issued once every 3 hours for unsuccessful recovery.

=== Internals ===

* The check will happen in regular intervals (quartz scheduler)
* Needs a DAO extension to fetch only those objects that are in failed state and have auto-recovery on
* It will call the respective commands (ActivateHost, ActivateStorageDomain), and let the commands do what they do
* Database needs to be extended with autorecovery information, default should be false to avoid surprises.
