== TUI redesign ==

=== Summary ===
This feature adds a new TUi to oVirt Node to address some shortcommings of the current implementation.

=== Owner ===
* Name: [[User:Fabiand|Fabian Deutsch]]
* Email: <fabiand@redhat.com>
* IRC: fabiand at #ovirt (irc.oftc.net)

=== Current status ===
* Completed: POC
* Completed: Design and document plugin layout
* In progress: Design UI layout for all pages/tui-plugins (Status, Network, ...)
* Pending: Implement logic for all pages/tui-plugins
* Pending: Update plugin documentation and create a plugin writer guide
* Last updated: Oct. 17. 2012

=== Detailed Description ===
The TUI rewrite will use a different TUI toolkit (urwid) which is maintained and easily extendable. Additionally it is event based. Besides that every page in the new TUI is a TUI-Plugin which communicates with the main TUI through a limited number of methods, this allows a good separation of functionality and representation.

The sources are currently hosted at https://www.gitorious.org/ovirt/ovirt-node-config-molch

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
The TUI solves problems with the old TUI:
* Reacts to terminal resizes
* Event based (no recursion problems)
* Much easier to extend
* UI not bound to specififc toolkit


=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
Self contained except a dependency on python-urwid (not in oVirt Node yet) and common oVirt Node py libraries.


=== Documentation / External references ===
TBD
