=== Deploy Attestation Service ===
Two approaches (all-in-one packages, yum install) are provided to deploy Attestation Service. Install via yum command will be available after oat package is merged in fedora 18 repository.

==== Install basic packages in Fedora18 (for all-in-one approach) ====
 yum -y install httpd
 yum -y install mysql mysql-server
 yum -y install php php-mysql
 yum -y install openssl
 yum -y install java-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64

==== Install Attestation Server Package ====
* Install all-in-one package
Build rpm package based on the source rpm package and install oat-appraiser package. Follow this link to get the source package.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/tboot/files/oat/oat-1.6.0-1.fc18.src.rpm
*  Yum Install oat server package from fedora18 repository (not available now).
 yum install oat-appraiser

==== Generate Client Files ====
Generate client files after installing oat-appraiser package, execute this command is enough.
 bash /usr/share/oat-appraiser/OAT_configure.sh
Client files will be output in this directory “/var/lib/oat-appraiser/ClientFiles/”. Part of these files are needed in agent’s side.

=== Deploy Host Agent on VDS ===
Two approaches (all-in-one packages, yum install) are provided to deploy Attestation Service; Install via yum command will be available after oat package is merged in fedora 18 repository.

==== Enable Intel® TXT in BIOS ====
Client system must have TPM 1.2 compliant device with driver installed, and TPM/TXT enabled in BIOS to perform the operation.
* Enable Intel® Trusted Execution Technology technology in BIOS
* Enable TPM in BIOS

==== Install basic Packages in Fedora18 (for all-in-one approach) ====
 yum install trousers-devel
 yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk

Make sure the TrouSers service is started before moving on. Service name in RHEL is “tcsd”

==== Install Host Agent Package ====
* Install all-in-one package
Build rpm package based on the source rpm package and install oat-client package. Follow this link to get the source package.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/tboot/files/oat/oat-1.6.0-1.fc18.src.rpm

*  Yum Install oat server package from fedora18 repository
 yum install oat-client

==== File copying and Agent Registration ====
Copy “PrivacyCA.cer” and “TrustStore.jks” from server side to agent side. Find these files under this directory (server side):
/var/lib/oat-appraiser/ClientFiles
Copy them to this directory (agent side):
/usr/share/oat-client

Go to this directory: /usr/share/oat-client/script, run provisioner.sh to register host agent.
 bash provisioner.sh

=== Install oat-command tool ===
* Install all-in-one package
Build rpm package based on the source rpm package and install oat-commandtool package. Follow this link to get the source package.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/tboot/files/oat/oat-1.6.0-1.fc18.src.rpm
* Yum Install oat-commandtool package from fedora18 repository.
 yum install oat-commandtool

Find 11 commands in “/usr/bin” directory, at least OEM, OS, MLE, and HOST information should be added to Attestation Server’s database.<br>
Exmaple (execute this command in "/usr/bin" directory):<br>
Generate certification:
 bash oat_cert  -h oatserver.*.com 

ADD OEM:
 bash oat_oem -a -h oatserver.*.com '{"Name":"OEM1","Description":"Newdescription"}'

ADD OS:
 bash oat_os -a -h oatserver.*.com '{"Name":"OS1","Version":"v1","Description":"Test1"}'

ADD VMM type MLE
 bash oat_mle -a -h oatserver.*.com '{"Name":"NewMLE2","Version":"v123","OsName":"OS1","OsVersion":"v1","Attestation_Type": "PCR","MLE_Type":"VMM","Description":"Test","MLE_Manifests": [{"Name": "18",  "Value": "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF"}]}'

ADD BIOS type MLE
 bash oat_mle -a -h oatserver.*.com '{"Name":"NewMLE1","Version":"v123","OemName":"OEM1","Attestation_Type": "PCR","MLE_Type":"BIOS","Description":"MLETest1111","MLE_Manifests": [{"Name": "0",  "Value": "31B97D97B4679*******D943635693FFBAB4143"}]}'

ADD HOST
 bash oat_host -a -h oatserver.*.com '{"HostName":"agent.*.com","IPAddress":"192.168.1.1","Port":"9999","BIOS_Name":"NewMLE1","BIOS_Version":"v123","BIOS_Oem":"OEM1","VMM_Name":"NewMLE2","VMM_Version":"v123","VMM_OSName":"OS1","VMM_OSVersion":"v1","Email":"","AddOn_Connection_String":"","Description":""}'

POLLHOSTS
 bash oat_pollhosts -h oatserver.*.com '{"hosts":["agent.*.com"]}'

=== Configuration in oVirt Engine === 
User may want to configure vdc_options to override the default values, these configurations include:<br>

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! options !! default value
|-
| SecureConnectionWithOATServers || true 
|-
| PollUri || AttestationService/resources/PollHosts
|-
| AttestationTruststore|| TrustStore.jks
|-
| AttestationPort || 8443
|-
| AttestationServer || oat-server
|-
| AttestationTruststorePass || password
|-
| AttestationFirstStageSize || 10
|}


currently, only  attestation server must be specified and modified, for other options, it is okay with the default value, please follow these script to modify "AttestationServer" :<br>
 insert into vdc_options (option_name, option_value) values (' AttestationServer','oat-server');
 update vdc_options set option_value = ‘oat-server. ***.com’ where option_name = 'AttestationServer'
