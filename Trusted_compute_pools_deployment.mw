=== Deploy Attestation Service ===
Two approaches (all-in-one packages, yum install) are provided to deploy Attestation Service. Install via yum command will be available after oat package is merged in fedora 18 repository.

==== Install basic packages in Fedora18 (for all-in-one approach) ====
 # yum -y install httpd mysql mysql-server php php-mysql openssl java-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64

==== Install Attestation Server Package ====
* Install all-in-one package
Download [http://gwei3.fedorapeople.org/package_review/oat/v1/oat-appraiser-1.6.0-1.fc18.x86_64.rpm oat-appraiser] rpm package, and then
 # rpm -i oat-appraiser-1.6.0-1.fc18.x86_64.rpm
*  Yum Install oat server package from fedora18 repository (not available now).
 yum install oat-appraiser

==== Generate Client Files ====
Generate client files after installing oat-appraiser package, execute this command is enough.
 bash /usr/share/oat-appraiser/OAT_configure.sh
Client files will be output in this directory “/var/lib/oat-appraiser/ClientFiles/”. Part of these files are needed in agent’s side.

=== Deploy Host Agent on VDS ===
Two approaches (all-in-one packages, yum install) are provided to deploy Attestation Service; Install via yum command will be available after oat package is merged in fedora 18 repository.

==== Install Fedora for Legacy Boot ====
The Fedora18 x86-64 system should be installed to run in legacy boot instead of EFI boot. Many new systems will by default boot as EFI boot, so you need to explicitly boot the installation media (DVD or USB) with legacy mode. Below is a example on HP8300:
* at the beginning of booting, ESC, enter setup password, F9 -> Boot Menu -> legacy boot from DVD
* install Fedora18 x86-64 from DVD

==== Enable Intel® TXT in BIOS ====
Client system must have TPM 1.2 compliant device with driver installed, and TPM/TXT enabled in BIOS to perform the operation. Below is a example for HP8300 system:
* Power on, ESC key -> Startup Menu -> Computer Setup(F10)
* Security->Setup Password, set setup password as xxxxxx then F10 save it.
* Security->System Security, enable vtx/vtd/Embeded Security Device/Trusted Execution Technology, F10 save it.
* File->Save Changes and Exit.

==== Install TPM Driver ====
 # yum install kernel-modules-extra
Reboot system and verify that /dev/tpm0 existed

==== Install tboot ====
Download corresponding sinit zip package from below url, copied the .BIN in it to /boot. (SKIP this step on server platforms)
* http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-trusted-execution-technology/ . Notes: for hp8300, we use 3rd_gen_i5_i7_SINIT_51.zip

Install tboot:
 # yum install trousers-devel tpm-tools tboot
 # service tcsd enable
 # service tcsd restart

Reboot machine and select tboot option in GRUB menu at start of booting.

Check the PCR values in TPM via the sysfs interface provided by TPM driver, make sure PCR-17~19 are not all FFs.

==== Install basic Packages in Fedora18 (for all-in-one approach) ====
 yum install trousers-devel
 yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk

Make sure the TrouSers service is started before moving on. Service name is “tcsd”

==== Install Host Agent Package ====
* Install all-in-one package
Build rpm package based on the source rpm package and install oat-client package. Follow this link to get the source package.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/tboot/files/oat/oat-1.6.0-1.fc18.src.rpm

*  Yum Install oat server package from fedora18 repository
 yum install oat-client

==== File copying and Agent Registration ====
Copy “PrivacyCA.cer” and “TrustStore.jks” from server side to agent side. Find these files under this directory (server side):
/var/lib/oat-appraiser/ClientFiles
Copy them to this directory (agent side):
/usr/share/oat-client

Go to this directory: /usr/share/oat-client/script, run provisioner.sh to register host agent.
 bash provisioner.sh

=== Install oat-command tool ===
* Install all-in-one package
Build rpm package based on the source rpm package and install oat-commandtool package. Follow this link to get the source package.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/tboot/files/oat/oat-1.6.0-1.fc18.src.rpm
* Yum Install oat-commandtool package from fedora18 repository.
 yum install oat-commandtool

Find 11 commands in “/usr/bin” directory, at least OEM, OS, MLE, and HOST information should be added to Attestation Server’s database.<br>
Exmaple (execute this command in "/usr/bin" directory):<br>
Generate certification:
 bash oat_cert  -h oatserver.*.com 

ADD OEM:
 bash oat_oem -a -h oatserver.*.com '{"Name":"OEM1","Description":"Newdescription"}'

ADD OS:
 bash oat_os -a -h oatserver.*.com '{"Name":"OS1","Version":"v1","Description":"Test1"}'

ADD VMM type MLE
 bash oat_mle -a -h oatserver.*.com '{"Name":"NewMLE2","Version":"v123","OsName":"OS1","OsVersion":"v1","Attestation_Type": "PCR","MLE_Type":"VMM","Description":"Test","MLE_Manifests": [{"Name": "18",  "Value": "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF"}]}'

ADD BIOS type MLE
 bash oat_mle -a -h oatserver.*.com '{"Name":"NewMLE1","Version":"v123","OemName":"OEM1","Attestation_Type": "PCR","MLE_Type":"BIOS","Description":"MLETest1111","MLE_Manifests": [{"Name": "0",  "Value": "31B97D97B4679*******D943635693FFBAB4143"}]}'

ADD HOST
 bash oat_host -a -h oatserver.*.com '{"HostName":"agent.*.com","IPAddress":"192.168.1.1","Port":"9999","BIOS_Name":"NewMLE1","BIOS_Version":"v123","BIOS_Oem":"OEM1","VMM_Name":"NewMLE2","VMM_Version":"v123","VMM_OSName":"OS1","VMM_OSVersion":"v1","Email":"","AddOn_Connection_String":"","Description":""}'

POLLHOSTS
 bash oat_pollhosts -h oatserver.*.com '{"hosts":["agent.*.com"]}'

=== Configuration in oVirt Engine === 
User may want to configure vdc_options to override the default values, these configurations include:<br>

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! options !! default value
|-
| SecureConnectionWithOATServers || true 
|-
| PollUri || AttestationService/resources/PollHosts
|-
| AttestationTruststore|| TrustStore.jks
|-
| AttestationPort || 8443
|-
| AttestationServer || oat-server
|-
| AttestationTruststorePass || password
|-
| AttestationFirstStageSize || 10
|}


currently, only  attestation server must be specified and modified, for other options, it is okay with the default value, please follow these script to modify "AttestationServer" :<br>
 insert into vdc_options (option_name, option_value) values (' AttestationServer','oat-server');
 update vdc_options set option_value = ‘oat-server. ***.com’ where option_name = 'AttestationServer'
