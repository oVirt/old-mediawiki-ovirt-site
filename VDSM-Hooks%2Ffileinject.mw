The fileinject hook is receives a target file name and its content and creates that file in target machine.

The hook will try to add the file only to the operating system partition, i.e.
* Windows: /c/myfile
* Linux: /myfile

Please note that in Windows the path is case sensitive!

syntax:
    fileinject=/<target file name> : <file content>
    fileinject=/myfile:some file content\n etc...
