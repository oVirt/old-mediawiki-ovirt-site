== Current status ==
* Target Release: 3.5
* Status: done

== Background ==
Up until now there were the following ways to create make a copy of the VM:
* Make a template, make a new VM from this template
* Make a snapshot and clone the snapshot

It would be useful to provide a way to clone a VM directly. 

== Implementation ==
All the logic is implemented in the CloneVmCommand class. Since it is very similar to cloning a VM from a snapshot, the common logic between the CloneVmCommand and AddVmFromSnapshotComman has been extracted to the common AddVmAndCloneImageCommand base class.

== Testing ==
== Test Case 1 ==
* Have a VM with no disks

* Clone the VM
* Verify the new VM has one disk
* Verify all the parameters of the VM have been cloned

== Test Case 3 ==
* Have a VM with two disks
* Clone the VM
* Verify the new VM has two disks
* Verify all the parameters of the VM have been cloned
