This page was created as a result of a [[http://lists.ovirt.org/pipermail/engine-devel/2013-August/005436.html discussion]] that started at @engine_devel. As we are considering an active/active architecture for Engine, we'll use this page to document required features and code changes that will be required.

# Locking. Currently Engine makes extensive use of Java synchronized capabilities to lock multiple requests hitting the same VDSM at the same time. This should be extended to be cross-machine. 
:However, if we replace HTTP transport protocol (and use push notifications), and since VDSM can support multiple concurrent requests, is the entire locking mechanism still necessary?
