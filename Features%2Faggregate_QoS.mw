== Aggregate QoS Objects ==
=== Description ===
While oVirt is rapidly continues to grow and gather features, it’s important to wrap already existing features with new ones, for better UX reasons.
In oVirt 3.5, there are going to be 2 new QoS objects, CPU  and [http://http://www.ovirt.org/Features/blkio-support: blkio] limits, added to the existing one [http://http://www.ovirt.org/Features/Network_QoS: network] QoS (since 3.3).

=== Detailed Description ===
==== Engine Core ==== 
* Introducing a new name space QoS, IQoS interface, and QoSType (network, cpu, storage).
* Data Base: extend netwok_qos, rename it to qos, have a type field (QoSType), all other limits wil be added here.
* [WiP/TBD] permissions: QoS Admin: includes all QoS action groups, and allowing to set permissions on QoS objects.

==== RESTful API ==== 
* [WiP] GET: api/capabilities/<version>/qos_type
* GET: /api/qos/ #list of qos objects
* GET: /api/qos/xxx #qos object

    <qos id=”xxx”>
        <name>qos_network_object</name>
        <type>network</type>
        <in..></>
        <out..></>
        ….
    <qos>

NOTE: the qos object will contain all limits from all types.
* PUT/DELETE methods are trivial.

==== GUI ==== 
* Remove network profile as a main tab.
* Add a splitter to network profiles subtab, and include permissions sub tab (UX RFE will be opened to make all ‘splitter subtabs’ to look better).
* Network QoS sub tab under data centers will be renamed to QoS.
* QoS sub tab will contain a vertical tab control with 4 values: All, Network, Storage, CPU:
each view will show a separate table including its limit, in All we’ll have a generic limit text, taken from IQoS, and the QoSType.
* [TBD] QoS as a main tab.
* [WiP] mockups to follow.

==== Open issues ==== 
* Is changing qos_type allowed.
* What happens when non-relevant limit fields are included (IMO ignore).
* Having ALL qos_type (IMO will be added in the future, not required for now).
