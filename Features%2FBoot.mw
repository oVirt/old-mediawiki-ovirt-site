== Detailed Description ==
This feature is about creating an iPXE based bootloader, pointing to the correct kickstart files in Jenkins.

The relevant files are around:
* iPXE script (embedded in iPXE bootloader)
* anaconda kernel, initrd and squashfs
* kickstart files pointing to the correct oVirt Engine/Node Appliance jobs
* oVirt Engine and Node Appliance images


== Benefit to oVirt ==
This is a very simple way to get oVirt up and running.
The idea is that a user will get a tested image when he installs oVirt through this feature. The testing of the images is part of the appliance build jobs.


== Dependencies / Related Features ==
* The appliance jobs need to provide the correct images.
** Engine Appliance: http://jenkins.ovirt.org/job/ovirt-appliance_engine-3.5_master_merged/
** Node Appliance: http://jenkins.ovirt.org/job/ovirt-appliance_node-3.5_master_merged/

== Documentation / External references ==
* Technical documentation: https://github.com/fabiand/boot-ovirt/blob/master/README.md


== Testing ==

:Note: This feature will download a lot of data from the internet. Thus the speed of the installation depends on the speed of your internet connection.

To test or use this feature:

# Download the ''ovirt-ipxe.iso'' or ''ovirt-ipxe.usb''
# Write the ISO or USB media image to an CD-ROM or a USB media or use it in a VM
# Boot the host or VM from the ISO or USB media
# Select ''Engine / Interactive Installation'' or ''Node / Interactive Installation''
# Wait for the installer to come up.
# Answer the unanswered questions and click ''Begin''
# Let the installation start
# Set a root password while the installation is running
# After the installation completes, the host will reboot
# Login using ''root'' and the password you set during the installation
# '''For Engine'''
## Run <code>engine-setup --config-append=ovirt-engine-answers</code> to setup engine
## Log into the web ui using ''admin'' and the password you've set during the <code>engine-setup</code>
## Add the Node appliance using the ''Add host'' menu item on the ''Hosts'' tab. Use ''root'' and the password set during the Node appliance installation


== Contingency Plan ==
None

== Release Notes ==

 == Boot oVirt.org ==
 An ISO and USB media image is available to provide a simple way to install the oVirt Engine and oVirt Node appliances.
