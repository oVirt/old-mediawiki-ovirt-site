User can optionally add arbitrary image (limited in dimensions, size, and format) - icon - to VM and Template entities. Icons are stored in 'vm_static' database table. If the icon is set, it is used instead of generic graphic in Userportal listings.

* Maximum dimensions are 150px x 120px (w x h) (based on Userportal > Basic icons)
* Maximum size is 100kB
* Icons are transferred and stored in dataUrl format.
* Icons are cached in browser based on their hashes  in order to save network resources during listing updates. 

===UI===

* Show icons in Userportal > Basic, Userpotal > Extended > Virtual Machines, Templates.
* Add icon editing and validating tab to 'New VM', 'Edit VM' and 'Edit Template' dialogs.
* Create per-session cache of Icons: Map<String, String> iconHash -> icon

===Backend===

* Extend commands saving VMs and templates to be able to validate and store icon.
* Extend queries for fetching VMs and templates by additional parameter to be able to provide either icon and its hash or icon hash only.
* Create new query to to separately fetch icon of certain <code>VmBase</code>d entity.
* Extend model VmBase by <code>String icon</code> property and <code>String iconHash</code> property

===Database===

* New nullable column 'icon' of type 'character varing' in table 'vm_static'
* New nullable column 'icon_hash' of type 'character' in table 'vm_static'
