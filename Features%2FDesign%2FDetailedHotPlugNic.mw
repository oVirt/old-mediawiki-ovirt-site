when adding a nic, store its plugged status as disabled, regardless if the VM is running or not.
The api will not implicitly plug it to a running VM.

sent to VDSM.

unplugging a nic when a VM is down updates its plugged flag in 
vm_device table to 'false'

when a nic is removed from a VM, remove its address from vm_device
