=== '''Summary''' ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
This feature must deprecate vdsm-reg and provide a vdsm-tool verb to make any supported distro (oVirt Node, CentOS, RHEL) be able to register against oVirt Engine using new registration schema.

=== '''Modules involved or affected by this Feature''' ===
* VDSM
* ovirt-node-plugin-vdsm
* ovirt-node

=== '''Detailed Description''' ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
This implementation will require:
* Create the new registration tool/library and integrate it with vdsm-tool.
* It should be smart enough to detect if the Engine provides the new registration protocol, if not, use the old registration schema for old Engine deploys
* Integrate it with oVirt Node TUI
* Create a new tool to handle autoinstall which should use vdsm-tool register  to add new node into Engine. (deprecate vdsm_reg/vdsm-config too)
* Persist conf files if it's oVirt node based distro

=== '''Benefit to oVirt''' ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
The vdsm-reg was implemented many years ago, should be refreshed with updated programming and using new registration service. Also, have a tool to register nodes in any oVirt supported distro.

=== '''Dependencies / Related Features''' ===
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->
No dependencies

=== '''Testing''' ===
As soon oVirt 3.6 be released with the patches merged users can register their Linux distro to became a hypervisor of oVirt using vdsm-tool register verb or using 
the refectory registration TAB in the oVirt Node TUI (Text User Interface). 

'''Example of testing''':
* First, '''make sure the node hostname is configured and oVirt Engine is able to reach it'''. The vdsm-tool register verb will use the hostname of node to register in oVirt Engine.
* In oVirt Node TUI:
