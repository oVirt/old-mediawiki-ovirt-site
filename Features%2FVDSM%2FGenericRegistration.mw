[[Category:VDSM]]

=== '''Summary''' ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
This feature must deprecate vdsm-reg and provide a vdsm-tool verb to make any supported distro (oVirt Node, CentOS, RHEL) be able to register against oVirt Engine using new registration schema.

=== '''Owner''' ===

=== '''Modules involved or affected by this Feature''' ===
* VDSM
* ovirt-node-plugin-vdsm
* ovirt-node
* ovirt-register

=== '''Detailed Description''' ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
This implementation will require:
* Create the new registration tool/library and integrate it with vdsm-tool.
* It should be smart enough to detect if the Engine provides the new registration protocol, if not, use the old registration schema to be compatible with old Engine deploys
* Integrate it with oVirt Node TUI
* Create a new tool to handle autoinstall which should use vdsm-tool register  to add new node into Engine. (deprecate vdsm_reg/vdsm-config too)
* Persist conf files if it's oVirt node based distro

=== '''Benefit to oVirt''' ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
The vdsm-reg was implemented many years ago, should be refreshed with updated programming and using new registration service. Also, have a tool to register nodes in any oVirt supported distro.

=== '''Dependencies / Related Features''' ===
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->
No dependencies

=== '''Testing''' ===
As soon oVirt 3.6 be released with the patches merged users can register their Linux distro to became a hypervisor of oVirt using vdsm-tool register verb or using 
the refectory registration TAB in the oVirt Node TUI (Text User Interface). 

'''Example of testing''':
* First, '''make sure the node hostname is configured and oVirt Engine is able to reach it'''. The vdsm-tool register verb will use the hostname of node to register in oVirt Engine.
* In oVirt Node TUI:

* In shell: 
  # vdsm-tool register --engine-fqdn engine.localdomain

For more options:
  # vdsm-tool register --help
  usage: vdsm-tool [-h] [--node-fqdn NODE_FQDN] [--node-name NODE_NAME]
                 --engine-fqdn ENGINE_FQDN
                 [--engine-https-port ENGINE_HTTPS_PORT] [--ssh-user SSH_USER]
                 [--ssh-port SSH_PORT] [--nocheck-fqdn CHECK_FQDN]
                 [--fingerprint FINGERPRINT] [--vdsm-port VDSM_PORT]
   Tool to register node to Engine<br>
  --engine-fqdn ENGINE_FQDN
                        Engine FQDN (See also: --check-fqdn)<br>
   optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --node-fqdn NODE_FQDN
                        Define node FQDN or IP address. If not provided, will be used system host name
  --node-name NODE_NAME
                        Define node name. If not provided, will be used system short host name (the name before the first dot in the system host name)
  --engine-https-port ENGINE_HTTPS_PORT
                        Define engine https port. If not provided, will be used 443
  --ssh-user SSH_USER   SSH username to establish the connection with Engine. If not provided, the user which is executing the script will catch and used
  --ssh-port SSH_PORT   SSH port to establish the connection with Engine If not provided, the script will use the default SSH port 22
  --nocheck-fqdn CHECK_FQDN
                        Disable or Enable FQDN check for Engine CA, this option is enabled by default (Use: True or False)
  --fingerprint FINGERPRINT
                        Specify an existing fingerprint to be validated against Engine CA fingerprint
  --vdsm-port VDSM_PORT
                        Specify the listen port of VDSM If not provided, will be used the default 54321
  Example of use:
ovirt-register --engine-fqdn engine.mydomain

* In Autoinstall:
For autoinstall users can keep using the already know boot keys: management_server, management_port, management_server_fingerprint, hostname, 
engine_admin_password.

'''management_server''': the key for oVirt Engine FQDN ('''required''')<br>
'''hostname''': specify oVirt Node hostname ('''required''', otherwise it will be localhost.localdomain and oVirt Engine won't reach it)<br>
'''management_port''': oVirt Engine https Port (default 443/https)<br>
'''management_server_fingerprint''':  used to validate the oVirt Engine CA, use in the format: 11:11:11:11:11<br>
'''engine_admin_password''': Set root password and Enable SSH  daemon
'''BOOTIF''': Network interface to be configured as ovirtmgmt network interface
'''firstboot''': Firstboot of node

Example for PXE or Grub for autoinstall of ovirt-node with '''dhcp''':
    firstboot storage_init=/dev/sda adminpw=RHhwCLrQXB8zE management_server=engine.localdomain BOOTIF=ens3 hostname=node.localdomain

Example for PXE or Grub for autoinstall of ovirt-node with '''static ip address''':
    firstboot storage_init=/dev/sda adminpw=RHhwCLrQXB8zE management_server=engine.localdomain BOOTIF=ens3 hostname=node.localdomain ip=192.168.122.125 netmask=255.255.255.0 gateway=192.168.122.1

Example for PXE or Grub for autoinstall specifying ovirt engine port ('''Use for non default https port. The default engine https port is 443''')
    firstboot storage_init=/dev/sda adminpw=RHhwCLrQXB8zE management_server=engine.localdomain:7443 BOOTIF=ens3 hostname=node.localdomain
