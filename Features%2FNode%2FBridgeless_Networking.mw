=== Summary ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
This feature will allow Node to not require a bridge in it's network configuration.
This change is very wide ranged and needs intensive testing.

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
Up to now the topology looked like:
<pre>
Node - Bridge - (Tagged) Nic
</pre>
In future it can also be:
<pre>
Node - (Tagged) Nic
</pre>


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
Some consumers of oVirt Node don't require the bridge or even conflict with an existing bridge on the system
By removing this (up to now) mandatory bridge, we open up Node to more consumers.

<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate?

* Affected Packages
** ovirt-node
** vdsm (possibly)
