= Console settings dialog in Webadmin and User Portal =

== Description/status ==
This feature has three main aims:
# to extract the console settings dialog from User Portal and use it in Webadmin as well
# to enhance this dialog with additional options that reflect recently added oVirt features, there are:
#* [[Features/Spice Proxy]] - MERGED
#* [[Features/Display Address Override]]
#* [[Features/Non plugin console invocation]]
#* [[Features/noVNC console]], SPICE HTML 5 client
# to make use of browser local storage to save configuration of the dialog per-VM - MERGED

== Limitations ==
* this feature will not allow changing console type from vnc to spice and vice versa (on running VM) as this affects the VM entity and requires VM restart

== Benefit to oVirt ==
This feature will allow quicke changing of console parameters from frontend.
