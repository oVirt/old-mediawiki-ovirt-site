== Description/status ==
This feature has these aims:
* to extract the console settings dialog from User Portal and use it in Webadmin as well - MERGED
* to enhance this dialog with additional options that reflect recently added oVirt features, there are:
** [[Features/Spice Proxy]] - DONE
** [[Features/Display Address Override]]
** [[Features/Non plugin console invocation]] - DONE
** [[Features/noVNC console]], [[Features/SpiceHTML5]] - DONE
* to make use of browser local storage to save configuration of the dialog per-VM - DONE

== Limitations ==
* this feature will not allow changing console type from VNC to SPICE and vice versa (on running VM) as this affects the VM entity and requires VM restart

== Benefit to oVirt ==
This feature will allow quick changing of console parameters from frontend.
