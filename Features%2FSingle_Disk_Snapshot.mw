== Single Disk Snapshot ==

=== Summary ===
Customization of snapshots with regards to VM configuration and disks.

* Name: [[User:Derez| Daniel Erez]]
* Email: <derez@redhat.com>

=== Current status ===
* Target Release: 3.4
* Status: work in progress
* Last updated: {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
* Allow creation of a customized snapshot. I.e. selecting which disks to take snapshot on.
* Custom snapshot preview:
** Previewing a new state by selecting VM configuration and disks from various snapshots.
** Support commit to the new state and undo to the previous one.
* Features based on specific disks snapshots, such as LSM, will benefit from the new support
** E.g. LSM will take a snapshot only on the migrated disks - as opposed to the current situation in which a snapshot is taken on all disks.

=== Detailed Description ===
Currently, a Snapshot represents a single point of time which contains the configuration of the VM and all attached disks.

I.e. creating/previewing/committing a snapshot must be done on the entire VM - including all the disks.

This feature introduces the ability to remove the constraint by allowing to exclude disks from a snapshot.

In addition, adds a new functionality of creating a customized snapshot composed of configuration and disk from multiple snapshots.

==== REST-API ====
Add <disks> tag to create/restore snapshot.

Note: preview only is not available from rest (restore = preview + commit).

E.g. POST /api/vms/{vm_id}/snapshots:

  <snapshot>
    <vm id="{vm_id}"/>
    <disks>
      <disk id="{disk_id}"/>
    </disks>
  </snapshot>

==== Backend ====
* CreateAllSnapshotsFromVmCommand
** The command should support handling a specified disks list.
** Disks not included in specified list should be 'fast-forwarded' to active snapshot (i.e. update snapshot id without creating a new snapshot).
* TryBackToAllSnapshotsOfVmCommand
** The command should support handling a specified disks list.
** Ability to preview a subset of VM disks.
** Allow previewing to various points of time (each specified image can define a different snapshot).
** Support previewing only disks while keeping the current VM configuration.
** Keeping old API from 'regular' preview.
* RestoreAllSnapshotsCommand
** Identify on which disks to perform snapshot undo/commit.
** Skip restore for excluded disks (but keep updating snapshot id accordingly).
* GetAllVmSnapshotsByVmIdQuery
** Configurable support to return the snapshots with appropriate images list.
** Fetch disks data from VM configuration which resides in the OVF (depending on UI design).
* Snapshot
** Add a list of disk images.

==== VDSM ====
Already supported.

=== Open Issues ===
* Custom Preview Dialog
** What to display at the bottom section?
*** "Result" - i.e. the state to preview.
*** VM configuration - i.e. the bottom section updates on configuration selection.
** Memory (applicable only for live snapshot)
*** Should we allow configuration/memory decoupling?
*** Or, configuration selection enforces the selection of memory from same snapshot (and vice versa)?
** Allow excluding a disk from preview (deselecting entire column)?
*** Excluding a disk implications are similar to deleting a disk (will result with an illegal disk on previous snapshots).

=== Comments and Discussion ===

=== Future Work ===
* Revise error flows
** E.g. failing to take a snapshot on one disk shouldn't rollback the entire snapshot, instead, just exclude the disk from the snapshot.
* Continue the decoupling of snapshot components and use single disks snapshots when needed, as in LSM flow.
* Create a snapshot form disk context
** Select a disk -> create snapshot (still requires including the VM configuration).
* Preview/commit/undo a snapshot from disk context
** Only a subset of the disks at a time, since creating a preview snapshot locks most VM operations (adding/removing disks, etc).
* Exclude VM configuration
** Do we want to allow creating a snapshot without VM configuration?
* Detach/Attach of disks with snapshots
** How to represent/display snapshots of a floating disk?
** How to handle attach of a disk with snapshots to a different VM?
* Profiles
** Creating a snapshot profiles (which allows single click snapshot). E.g. 'VM configuration + OS disk profile' / etc.
