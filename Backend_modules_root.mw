'''Introduction:'''
Root is a web app that presents the landing page for the oVirt project. The root directory contains the 'webapp' subdirectory which contains the .html, .css and .js files that make up the landing page. The root project also includes a couple of Java classes: FileServlet receives a mime type and a file name as parameters and serves the content of that file, and PKIResourceServlet that handles [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure PKI resources].

'''Visualization:''' This is how the landing page looks like in oVirt 3.2, in Firefox 17.
