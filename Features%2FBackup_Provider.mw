=== Detailed Description ===
The situation prior to this feature is the following:<br/>
There's code collecting data into an ovf in the Master Storage Domain (MSD from here on).
That's it. No other code is implemented for reading it (restore).<br/>
This feature's intention is first to rearrange the code taking care of generating the ovf files as a Provider - Backup Provider.
This feature will also add other persisting methods other than MSD, enabling different types of the Backup Provider.
The Settings for each Backup Provider will vary according to what the specific type requires.
Finally we will add the restore functionality, which is currently missing from the code altogether.
====Phase 1====
Extract the current code into a Backup Provider.<br/>
The backup will be on the system level, applied to all DC's in the system as default, with the option to do it for only one DC.
The code extraction will result in one specific Provider of type MSD.
====Phase 2=====
* Persist the ovf to the following different locations (in addition to MSD):
* Local FS
