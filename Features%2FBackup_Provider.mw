=== Detailed Description ===
The situation prior to this feature is the following:<br/>
There's code collecting data into an ovf in the Master Storage Domain (MSD from here on).
That's it. No other code is implemented for reading it (restore).<br/>
This feature's intention is first to rearrange the code taking care of generating the ovf files as a Provider - Backup Provider.<br/>
This feature will also add other persisting methods other than MSD, enabling different types of the Backup Provider.
The Settings for each Backup Provider will vary according to what the specific type requires.<br/>
Finally we will add the restore functionality, which is currently missing from the code altogether.
====Phase 1====
Extract the current code into a Backup Provider.<br/>
The backup will be on the system level, applied to all DC's in the system as default, with the option to do it for only one DC.
The code extraction will result in one specific Provider of type MSD.
====Phase 2====
* Persist the ovf to the following different locations (in addition to MSD):
** Local FS - We may want to persist the ovfs to a DB. Other than the relative simplicity of using SQL rather than FS hierarchy for the ovf files, another motivation for this metod is the fact that we need to display all VMs to the user when restoring (The user  may want to pick which VMs he wants to restore). For this, we need VM identities, specifically names. Since Guids aren't enough it might be simplest to use a DB to hold the some more data on the ovf.
** Swift (?)
** Debug (?) - We may want to create a Debug Provider for debug purposes only, not exposed to the end user.
** NoOp - We may want to use nothing. Backup, if used, should be chroned every x minutes. It may be easier to run it anyway, just as a default NoOp Backup Provider should no other provider is specificaly configured. Still to be decided. 
* Restore the system. The user will be able to pick which VMs he wants to restore, and how many of each of them, resembling import.
* Attach existing Backup Provider.  For example, should a user stop backup and then want to re-attach it. The user may be also able to add an existing Backup Provider (with data) to a new system.
The user should be prompted whether to pick up from latest backup or start from scratch.
