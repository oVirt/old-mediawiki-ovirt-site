1. before_disk_hotplug<br/>
2. after_disk_hotplug<br/>

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
The feature allows customers to add their own functionality before hot-plugging and hot-unplugging disks.<br/> This can be done by adding scripts performing custom behaviour.<br/>
More details regarding the actual usage can be found [[VDSM-Hooks|here]] and [https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.0/html/Administration_Guide/VDSM_Hooks.html/ here].
