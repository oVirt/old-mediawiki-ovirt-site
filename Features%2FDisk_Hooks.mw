=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
This feature adds four hooking points to vdsm, for before and after a disk's hot plug and unplug from a VM.<br/>
These hooking ponts are named:<br/>
1. before_disk_hotplug<br/>
2. after_disk_hotplug<br/>
3. before_disk_hotunplug<br/>
4. after_disk_hotunplug<br/>

The above hooking points are defined in vdsm/hooks.py, and used in vdsm/libvirtvm.py.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
The feature allows customers to add their own functionality before hot-plugging and hot-unplugging disks.<br/> This can be done by adding scripts performing custom behaviour.<br/>
