A more elaborate list of changes:-->
=== Virt ===
* [[Features/RAM Snapshots|RAM Snapshots]] enable users to save (and later restore) the memory state of a VM when creating a live snapshot.

* [[Features/noVNC console|noVNC console]] integration makes it possible to connect to VM consoles using the HTML 5 VNC client called "noVNC" in browsers supporting websockets and the HTML5 postMessage function (webkit browsers, Firefox, IE > 10).

* [[Features/GlusterFS_Storage_Domain|GlusterFS Storage Domain]] is a new storage domain and data center type which uses gluster as the storage backend. VMs created using this domain take advantage of QEMU's gluster block backend for improved performance.

* [[Features/Cloud-Init_Integration|Cloud-Init Integration]] facilitates provisioning of virtual machines by enabling oVirt to perform initial setup (including networking, SSH keys, timezone, user data injection, and more) of guest instances configured with cloud-init.

=== Infra ===
* [[Features/Device Custom Properties|Device Custom Properties]] allow administrators to define special parameters per VM virtual device, and pass them down to vdsm hooks, as has previously been possible on a per VM basis. Device custom properties will allow, for instance, for users to connect vNICs to non-standard host networks.

* [[Features/ExternalTasks|External Tasks Support]] makes it possible for a third-party plugin to inject tasks into oVirt Engine using the REST API, to change task statuses and allow them to be tracked from the UI.

* [[Features/Supervdsm_service|SuperVDSM Service]] enables Vdsm to be run as an unprivileged daemon, thereby simplifying the handling of crashes and the process of re-establishing communication between Vdsm and Supervdsm after failures.

* [[Features/Java_SDK|Java-SDK]] is an auto-generated software development kit for the oVirt engine api.

* [[Features/Ssh_Abilities|Public Key SSH Authentication]] is now available as a means of conducting authentication for host-deploy and node upgrade operations, supplementing the existing user/password mechanism.

=== Networking ===
* [[Features/Migration Network|Migration Networks]] enable administrators to assign networks for carrying migration data.
* [[Features/Normalized ovirtmgmt Initialization|Normalized ovirtmgmt Initialization]] involves generating the ovirtmgmt network based on DC definitions using the setupNetworks function, rather than during new host deployment.
* [[Features/Quantum_Integration|OpenStack Neutron Integration]] adds support for using OpenStack Neutron as an external network provider, which can provide networking capabilities for consumption by oVirt hosts and/or virtual machines.
''* [[Feature/NetworkReloaded]] reimplementation of configNetwork in vdsm. Should have zero (0) effect on users, but required for future support for ovs/NM''
* [[Features/Multiple Gateways|Multiple Gateways]] allows users to define a gateway per logical network, where, previously, the gateway defined on the ovirtmgmt logical network had been treated as the host-wide default gateway.

=== Storage ===
* [[Features/Online_Virtual_Drive_Resize|Enable online virtual drive resize]]
* [[Features/Virtio-SCSI|Virtio-SCSI support]]
* [[Features/Read_Only_Disk| Read Only Disks ]]
* [[Features/Edit_Connection_Properties|Edit Connection Properties]]
* [[Features/Disk_Hooks|Adding VDSM hooks for hotplugging/unplugging a disk]]
* [[Features/MoveAsCopyAndDelete|Separating "Move" vm operation to "Copy" and "Delete" operations to improve VM availability]] 
* [[Features/Backup-Restore_API_Integration|Backup and Restore API for Independent Software Vendors]] 
* Allow resign/force re-election of SPM
* [[Features/DiskAlignment|Disks Block Alignment]]
* [[Features/Glance_Integration|Integration with Glance]]

=== SLA & Scheduling ===
* [[Features/oVirt_scheduler]] Wrapping scheduling functionalities as a separate package
* [[Features/Scheduling_API]] (depends on [[Features/oVirt_scheduler]]) exposing user-level scheduling API
* [[Features/Watchdog_engine_support]]
* [[Features/Network_QoS]]
* [[Trusted_compute_pools]]

=== Gluster  ===
* [[Features/Gluster Hooks Management]] Managing gluster hooks from console
** Status : In Progress
** gerrit : 
***http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/q/project:ovirt-engine+branch:master+topic:gluster-hooks,n,z
***http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/14145

=== Node  ===
* [[Features/Universal Image|Universal Node Image]]  make the ovirt-node image generic for use with non-oVirt Projects
* [[Features/Node vdsm plugin|Node VDSM Plugin]] extract all vdsm and oVirt Engine specific code from ovirt-node into a plugin
* oVirt Node works on a different asynchronous release schedule from the rest of oVirt.  
** At the time of the oVirt 3.3 release, the current version of ovirt-node will be 3.0.0.  
** Feature for oVirt node 3.0.0 can be found on the [[Node_3.0_release-management|oVirt Node 3.0.0 release page]]

=== Integration  ===
* (MUST) [[Features/Otopi_Infra_Migration]] A complete re-write of engine-setup, engine-cleanup, engine-upgrade and AIO plugin using otopi. 
* (SHOULD) [[Features/Self_Hosted_Engine]]  The ability to run the Engine as a VM on the hosts that are managed by this Engine, in an HA configuration, when the Engine VM can start on any of the hosts.
