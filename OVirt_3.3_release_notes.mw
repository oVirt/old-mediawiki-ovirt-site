A more elaborate list of changes:-->
=== Virt ===
* [[Features/RAM Snapshots|RAM Snapshots]] enable users to save (and later restore) the memory state of a VM when creating a live snapshot.

* [[Features/noVNC console|noVNC console]] integration makes it possible to connect to VM consoles using the HTML 5 VNC client called "noVNC" in browsers supporting websockets and the HTML5 postMessage function (webkit browsers, Firefox, IE > 10).

* [[Features/GlusterFS_Storage_Domain|GlusterFS Storage Domain]] is a new storage domain and data center type which uses gluster as the storage backend. VMs created using this domain take advantage of QEMU's gluster block backend for improved performance.

* [[Features/Cloud-Init_Integration|Cloud-Init Integration]] facilitates provisioning of virtual machines by enabling oVirt to perform initial setup (including networking, SSH keys, timezone, user data injection, and more) of guest instances configured with cloud-init.

=== Infra ===
* [[Features/Device Custom Properties|Device Custom Properties]] allow administrators to define special parameters per VM virtual device, and pass them down to vdsm hooks, as has previously been possible on a per VM basis. Device custom properties will allow, for instance, for users to connect vNICs to non-standard host networks.

* [[Features/ExternalTasks|External Tasks Support]] makes it possible for a third-party plugin to inject tasks into oVirt Engine using the REST API, to change task statuses and allow them to be tracked from the UI.

* [[Features/Supervdsm_service|SuperVDSM Service]] enables Vdsm to be run as an unprivileged daemon, thereby simplifying the handling of crashes and the process of re-establishing communication between Vdsm and Supervdsm after failures.

* [[Features/Java_SDK|Java-SDK]] is an auto-generated software development kit for the oVirt engine api.

* [[Features/Ssh_Abilities|Public Key SSH Authentication]] is now available as a means of conducting authentication for host-deploy and node upgrade operations, supplementing the existing user/password mechanism.

=== Networking ===
* [[Features/Migration Network|Migration Networks]] enable administrators to assign networks for carrying migration data.
* [[Features/Normalized ovirtmgmt Initialization|Normalized ovirtmgmt Initialization]] involves generating the ovirtmgmt network based on DC definitions using the setupNetworks function, rather than during new host deployment.
* [[Features/Quantum_Integration|OpenStack Neutron Integration]] adds support for using OpenStack Neutron as an external network provider, which can provide networking capabilities for consumption by oVirt hosts and/or virtual machines.
* [[Feature/NetworkReloaded]] reimplementation of configNetwork in vdsm. Should have zero (0) effect on users, but required for future support for ovs/NM
* [[Features/Multiple Gateways|Multiple Gateways]] allows users to define a gateway per logical network, where, previously, the gateway defined on the ovirtmgmt logical network had been treated as the host-wide default gateway.

=== Storage ===
* [[Features/Online_Virtual_Drive_Resize|Online Virtual Drive Resize]] allows oVirt users to resize virtual disks while they are in use by one or more virtual machines without the need of pausing, hibernating or rebooting the guests.

* [[Features/Virtio-SCSI|Virtio-SCSI]] is a new para-virtualized SCSI controller device which provides the same performance as the virtio-blk device, while improving scalability, supporting standard SCSI command sets and device naming, allowing for SCSI device passthrough.

* [[Features/Read_Only_Disk| Read Only Disk]] enables users to assign a read-only property to the VM-Disk relationship when adding/attaching a disk to a vm through the oVirt engine.

* [[Features/Edit_Connection_Properties|Manage Storage Connections]] adds the ability to add, edit and delete storage connections. The new connection details must match those of the original connection. For example, an NFS storage connection cannot be edited to point to iSCSI.

* [[Features/Disk_Hooks|Disk Hooks]] adds VDSM hooking points before and after disk hot plug and hot unplug events, enabling the running of guest-level operations on the disks when they're plugged/unplugged.

* [[Features/MoveAsCopyAndDelete|MoveAsCopyAndDelete]] splits disk moving operations in oVirt into separate copy and delete operations, where, previously, they had been carried out by vdsm in a single operation. This change improves availability and error-handling.

* [[Features/Backup-Restore_API_Integration|Backup-Restore API Integration]] provides the ability for ISVs to backup and restore VMs. A new set of APIs will be introduced in oVirt to facilitate taking full VM backup, as well as full or file level restore of VMs.

* Allow resign/force re-election of SPM

* [[Features/DiskAlignment|Disks Block Alignment]] provides a way in oVirt to find virtual disks with misaligned partitions.

* [[Features/Glance_Integration|Glance Integration]] allows oVirt users to consume, export and share images with Glance. These images are exposed as oVirt Templates.

=== SLA & Scheduling ===
* [[Features/oVirt_scheduler]] Wrapping scheduling functionalities as a separate package
* [[Features/Scheduling_API]] (depends on [[Features/oVirt_scheduler]]) exposing user-level scheduling API
* [[Features/Watchdog_engine_support]]
* [[Features/Network_QoS]]
* [[Trusted_compute_pools]]

=== Gluster  ===
* [[Features/Gluster Hooks Management]] Managing gluster hooks from console
** Status : In Progress
** gerrit : 
***http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/q/project:ovirt-engine+branch:master+topic:gluster-hooks,n,z
***http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/14145

=== Node  ===
* [[Features/Universal Image|Universal Node Image]]  make the ovirt-node image generic for use with non-oVirt Projects
* [[Features/Node vdsm plugin|Node VDSM Plugin]] extract all vdsm and oVirt Engine specific code from ovirt-node into a plugin
* oVirt Node works on a different asynchronous release schedule from the rest of oVirt.  
** At the time of the oVirt 3.3 release, the current version of ovirt-node will be 3.0.0.  
** Feature for oVirt node 3.0.0 can be found on the [[Node_3.0_release-management|oVirt Node 3.0.0 release page]]

=== Integration  ===
* (MUST) [[Features/Otopi_Infra_Migration]] A complete re-write of engine-setup, engine-cleanup, engine-upgrade and AIO plugin using otopi. 
* (SHOULD) [[Features/Self_Hosted_Engine]]  The ability to run the Engine as a VM on the hosts that are managed by this Engine, in an HA configuration, when the Engine VM can start on any of the hosts.
