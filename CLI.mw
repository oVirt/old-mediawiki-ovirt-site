__TOC__


== Maintainer ==

Michael Pasternak: mpastern@redhat.com

* Generic interface (list, show, create, update, action verbs).
* Interactive prompt
* Auto-completion.
* Self descriptive.


== Usage ==


=== Connect ===

1. access interactive shell

  ovirt-shell


2. issue connect command 

  connect "http://host:port/api" "user@domain" "password"


=== Help ===

1. help 'COMMAND', e.g:

=== Running Query ===

=== Creating resource ===


[[File:create.jpg]]


=== Updating resource ===


[[File:update.jpg]]


=== Performing action on resource ===

== Repository ==

* git://gerrit.ovirt.org/ovirt-engine-cli 


== Deployment ==

=== rpm ===

To build rpm and install it, from ovirt-engine-cli repo:

 yum install rpm-build

 yum install python-devel

 yum install python-setuptools

 make rpm

 yum localinstall rpmtop/RPMS/noarch/ovirt-engine-cli-x.y-z.noarch.rpm


Because lxml is not yet packaged, please follow the instructions below to get lxml installed.

=== development deployment ===

For local install in site-packages, from ovirt-engine-cli repo:

 yum install python-ply libxml2-devel libxslt-devel pexpect 
 python setup.py develop


That will install lxml, because EPEL's python-lxml is not yet up to the version required by CLI.

* note: both deployment procedures require super-user permissions

== TODO list ==

* parameters formatting

* generic parameters assignment 

  - right now parameters assign to parameters classes by static
    mapping in metadata, it should be done in a generic way.
