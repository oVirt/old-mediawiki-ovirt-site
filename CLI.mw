== Deployment ==

=== rpm ===

To build rpm and install it, from ovirt-engine-cli repo:

 yum install rpm-build

 yum install python-devel

 yum install python-setuptools

 make rpm

 yum localinstall rpmtop/RPMS/noarch/ovirt-engine-cli-x.y-z.noarch.rpm

=== local deployment ===

For local install in site-packages, from ovirt-engine-cli repo:

 yum install python-ply

 python setup.py develop

* note: both deployment procedures require super-user permissions


== TODO list ==

* parameters formatting

* generic parameters assignment 

  - right now parameters assign to parameters classes by static
    mapping in metadata, it should be done in a generic way.
