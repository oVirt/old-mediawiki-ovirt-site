We want to keep the oVirt Community a great place to participate, but we need your help to keep it that way. While we have specific guidelines for various tools, in general, you should:
* Be nice
* Keep it clean
* Keep it legal
* Stay on topic

== Mailing list guidelines ==
== IRC guidelines ==
== Wiki contribution guidelines ==
== Bug reporting guidelines ==


== Guideline Violations - 3 Strikes Method ==
The point of this section is not to find opportunities to punish people, but we do need a fair way to deal with people who are making our community an unpleasant place.
* First occurrence: Public reminder that the behavior is inappropriate according to our guidelines.
* Second occurrence: Private message warning the user that any additional violations will result in removal from the community.
* Third occurrence: Depending on the violation, may include account deletion or banning. 

'''Notes:'''
* Obvious spammers are banned on first occurrence. This is necessary to keep the community free of spam.
* Violations are forgiven after extended periods of good behavior.
* Minor formatting / style infractions will be dealt with through education, not the 3 strikes process.
* Extreme violations of a threatening, abusive, destructive or illegal nature will be addressed immediately and are not subject to 3 strikes.
* Contact [[User:DNeary|Dave neary]] to report abuse or appeal violations (mistakes happen & will be corrected).
