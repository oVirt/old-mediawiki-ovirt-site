== Current status ==
* Target Release: 
* Status: Design Stage
* Last updated date: Sun January 25 2011  
    

== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Provide the details of the feature. What is it going to include. See the sections below. -->
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->
The feature provides administration and management functionalities for floating disks.<BR>
A floating disk should behave as a flexible independent entity that can be moved/copied across various storage domains in the Data Center.<BR>
Any virtual disk can be in a floating state - by unattaching the disk from the VM/s. 

=== Entity Description ===

==== Disk ====
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->
* Floating state should be added to disk entity - floating / not floating.
* Name and Description should be added to disk entity (disk name ought to be unique for search and display purposes).
* Disk must be a searchable entity for providing search/sort/display capabilities under 'Virtual Disks' main tab.

=== Functionality ===
* A floating disk can be attached to any VM (or multiple VMs in case of a Shared Disk).
* Detaching a disk from a VM will result in a floating disk creation (i.e. the disk's state will be updated to 'floating').
* A floating disk can be moved between storage domains.  
* Export/Import - not supported.

=== Installation/Upgrade ===
<!-- Describe how the feature will effect new installation or existing one. -->
* Installation
** New/Edit disk: 
*** Should enforce the user to enter a unique name.
*** New optional field - Description.
* Upgrade
** Disk name should be generated automatically - in order to maintain uniqueness.
** Disk description should remain empty.

=== User Experience ===
<!-- Describe user experience related issues. For example: We need a wizard for ...., the behaviour is different in the UI because ....., etc. -->
<!-- GUI mockups should also be added here to make it more clear -->

====  Administrator Portal ====
* CRUD - Introducing a new 'Virtual Disks' main tab
** Includes the following sub-tabs.
*** Storage - a list of Storage Domains.
*** Templates - a list of Templates.
*** Virtual Machines - a list of Virtual Machines (with Plugged/UnPlugged status column).
** Contains a list of all the disks in the system - sortable by Floating/Shared/Managed attributes.
** Each row is composed of the following columns:<BR> 
 Name (unique), Description, Size, Actual Size, Type, Allocation, Interface, Creation Date, Floating(Yes/No), Shared(Yes/No), Managed(Yes/No). 
* VMs -> Disks sub-tab  
** Attach/Detach disks.
** Edit/Delete disks.
** Move disks between storage domains.
* Tree
** 'Resources' link under 'Storage' node - a search of all the Floating/Shared/Direct LUN disks in the Data Center.

====  User Portal ====
The Power User Portal should allow the following operations:
* Attach/Detach only shared disks to a VM - disks sub-tab.
  Note:<BR>
  For now, premissions for disk entities will *not* be supported.<BR> 
  Consequently, availabilty of disks will be deterimined by their type (i.e. users can attach only shared disks).<BR>

==== Mockups ====
The following UI mockups contain guidelines for the different screens and wizards:
