== Current status ==
* Target Release: 
* Status: Design Stage
* Last updated date: Sun January 25 2011  
    

== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Provide the details of the feature. What is it going to include. See the sections below. -->
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->
The feature introduces a significant improvement to oVirt compatibility and flexabilty regarding disks usage. It provides administration and management functionalities for floating disks.<BR>
A floating disk should behave as a flexible independent entity that can be attached to any VM.
Any virtual disk can be in a floating state - by unattaching the disk from the VM/s.<BR>
Supporting a floating state for disks is essential to derived features (e.g. 'Shared RAW Disk' and 'Direct LUN Disk')
and dependent implementations (e.g. application clustering, shared data warehouse). 

=== Entity Description ===

==== Disk ====
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->
* Floating state should be added to disk entity - floating / not floating.
* Name and Description should be added to disk entity (disk name ought to be unique for search and display purposes).
* Disk must be a searchable entity for providing search/sort/display capabilities under 'Virtual Disks' main tab.
* Open issue: adding an indication whether the disk is originated from a VM or a template (useful for filtering 'Virtual Disks' sub-tabs).

=== Functionality ===
* A floating disk can be attached to any VM (or multiple VMs in case of a Shared Disk).
* Detaching a disk from a VM will result in a floating disk creation (i.e. the disk's state will be updated to 'floating').
* A floating disk can be moved between storage domains.  
* Export/Import - not supported.

=== Installation/Upgrade ===
<!-- Describe how the feature will effect new installation or existing one. -->
* Installation
** New/Edit disk: 
*** Should enforce the user to enter a unique name.
*** New optional field - Description.
* Upgrade
** Disk name should be generated automatically - in order to maintain uniqueness.
** Disk description should remain empty.

=== User Experience ===
<!-- Describe user experience related issues. For example: We need a wizard for ...., the behaviour is different in the UI because ....., etc. -->
<!-- GUI mockups should also be added here to make it more clear -->

====  Administrator Portal ====
* CRUD - Introducing a new 'Virtual Disks' main tab
** Contains a list of all the disks in the system - sortable by Floating/Shared/Managed attributes.
** Actions - at first stage, only a few actions will be included (first subset will probably include 'Remove Disk')
** Includes the following sub-tabs.
*** Storage:
**** List of Storage Domains in which the selected Disk resides.
*** Templates (visible for disks that reside in templates):
**** List of Templates to which the selected Disk is attached.
*** Virtual Machines (visible for disks that reside in VMs):
**** List of Virtual Machines to which the selected Disk is attached.
**** Should include Plugged/UnPlugged status column.
**** Actions:
***** Attach - dialog with a list of available VMs (all VMs with 'Down' status within the disk's Data Center).
***** Detach - detaches the selected Disk from the selected VM.
** Each row is composed of the following columns:<BR> 
 Name (unique), Description, Size, Actual Size, Type, Allocation, Interface, Creation Date, Floating(Yes/No), Shared(Yes/No), Managed(Yes/No). 
* VMs -> Disks sub-tab  
** Attach/Detach disks.
** Edit/Remove disks.
** Move disks between storage domains.
* Open Issue - Tree
** 'Resources' link under 'Storage' node - invokes a search of all the Floating/Shared disks in the Data Center.
** 'Free Disks' link under a new 'Resources' node - invokes a search of all the Floating/Shared/DirectLUN disks in the Data Center.

====  User Portal ====
The Power User Portal should allow the following operations:
* Attach/Detach only managed shared disks to a VM (through disks sub-tab).
  Note:<BR>
  For now, premissions for disk entities will *not* be supported.<BR> 
  Consequently, availabilty of disks will be deterimined by their type (i.e. users can attach only shared disks).<BR>

==== Mockups ====
The following UI mockups contain guidelines for the different screens and wizards:

== Dependencies / Related Features and Projects ==
<!-- What other packages (RPMs) depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? Add a link to the feature description for relevant features. -->
Affected oVirt projects:
* API
* CLI
* Engine-core
* Webadmin
* User Portal

Quota should be taken into consideration for every new feature that involves consumption of resources.<BR>
Shared raw disk will be dependent on floating disk.

== Future Work ==
* More actions should be added to Disks main tab: New/Edit/Remove/Move/Copy/etc.
* Consider adding permissions support to disks entities.

== Open Issues ==
<!-- Issues that we haven't decided how to take care of yet. These are issues that we need to resolve and change this document accordingly. -->
