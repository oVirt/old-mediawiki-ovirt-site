=== Summary ===
We plan to start a migration process of our current DAO access layer to a more standard, JPA based, DAO layer. 

=== Owner ===

* Name: Liran Zelkha

=== Current Status ===

Implementation

=== Implementation Process ===
We will start with the following:
# Patch to add Hibernate and persistence.xml to the environment. See http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/33832/ http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/33835/
# Patch to move the Bookmark entity to JPA. See http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/33836/
# Patch to move the Providers entity to JPA
# Patch to move the Job entity to JPA
# Patch to move the VdsGroup entity to JPA

Other entities will be moved after that

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
* Performance issues. Things like caching, connection life cycle, etc are provided by many JPA frameworks. We expect major performance improvements in oVirt Engine on account of this change
* Simplicity issues. Multiple stored procedures, complex views, manually writing row-mapper classes - all can be avoided by using the JPA framework.
