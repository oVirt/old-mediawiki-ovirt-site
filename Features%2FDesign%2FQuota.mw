= Quota =
This document describes the design for the Quota feature.

== Motivation ==
Ovirt makes it very easy for users to add VMs, thus using CPU, memory and storage resources, thus there is a requirement that system administrators will be able to limit the resource usage of users in the environment by setting a Quota on these resources.<BR> The resources in scope for this feature are:

# Per-cluster resources:
## Virtual CPUs
## Virtual RAM
# Storage resources
... ... ...

Please see http://www.ovirt.org/wiki/Features/Quota

== GUI ==

# unlimited quota - vds_group_id=null and storage_id=null in quota_limitation table and fields of vcpu, vram and storage will be initialized with -1.
# general limited quota - vds_group_id=null and storage_id=null in quota_limitation table, fields of vcpu, vram and storage will be initialized with specific number.
# specific limited quota - vds_group_id!=null and/or storage_id!=null in quota_limitation table, quota fields (vcpu, vram and storage) will be null.
# quota without any resources - vds_group_id=null and storage_id=null in quota_limitation table, quota fields (vcpu, vram and storage) will be 0.

===== Stored Procedures =====
''GetQuotaVdsGroupByVdsGroupGuid''
* Input - vds_group_id UUID, storage_pool_id UUID.
* Output - a business entity mapped by quota_vds_group_view for specified vds_group with vds_group_id. (if vds_group_id=null then returns a list of all the vds group quotas for the storage pool_id)

''GetQuotaStorageByStorageGuid''
* Input - storage_id UUID, storage_pool_id UUID.
* output - a business entity mapped by quota_storage_view for specified cluster_id, (if storage_id=null then returns a list of all the quota Storage for the storage pool_id)


''GetQuotaByStoragePoolGuid''
* Input - storage_pool_id UUID.
* output - a business entity mapped by quota_global_view for specified storage_pool_id, (if storage_pool_id=null then returns a list of all the quota in the setup)

=== Logic Design ===
Each time the user will run a VM or create a new disk, there will be a quota resource check against the quota views.<BR> 
The process of quota validation should be in a new method validateQuota which will be a part of the command execute process.
the  validateQuota should be executed as synchronize method after canDoAction and before the command execute method.<BR/>
Each command which consumes quota resources, will contain a list of the delta changes, respectively quotaManager will manage a delta HashMap of the resources until they are persisted in the DB.


===== Synchronized Vds commands =====
Synchronized Vds commands are commands such as Create VM or migrate VM.<BR/>
These commands increase the consumption for cluster quota, right when the engine calls createVmCommandVDSCommand.<BR/>
Before calling the vds command, there will be a synchronize check, using quotaVdsGroupUsage function with the memory delta map, if there is enough resource space in the quota, the memory delta concurrent map, will be updated with the VM resources.<BR/>
if there will not be enough resources for the VM cunsumption, we will decrease the memory table with the amount of resources we checked.

===== A-synchronized Vds commands =====
Asynchronized operations, reflected in the engine as tasks.<BR>
The tasks which are being handled are : 
 unknown,
 copyImage,
 moveImage,
 createVolume,
 deleteVolume,
 deleteImage,
 mergeSnapshots,
 moveMultipleImages;

'''Tasks For Commands'''
{|class="wikitable sortable"
!border="1"| command name ||Storage / Cluster || Task Name || Vds Command
|-
|CreateCloneOfTemplateCommand ||Storage ||copyImage ||CopyImageVDSCommand
|-
|CreateImageTemplateCommand ||Storage ||copyImage ||CopyImageVDSCommand
|-
|CreateCloneOfTemplateCommand ||Storage ||copyImage ||CopyImageVDSCommand
|-
|MoveMultipleImageGroupsCommand ||Storage||moveImage ||MoveImageGroupVDSCommand
|-

|-
|}

For a-synchronized operations behaviour, the operation functionality should be similar to the synchronize functionality.
The Quota storage delta and the command list property will be updated before the execute starts with the planned quantity that should be consume.
After every creation of task the delta map will be decreased and also the list command member.
If the operation will fail, the rest of the quantity in the list will be decreased from the delta map.

===== Upgrade Behaviour =====
When a system is upgraded, an automatic script will create a Default Quota for each DC, with permissions for every one, and unlimited space for storage and cluster use.<BR> The DC status should be disabled (same as when a new DC is established).<BR> The disabled status of the DC represents that the user should not see any indications in the GUI that the DC has a Quota defined on it.
When the DC is set to disabled mode, the Default Quota will be the one that all the resources consumed from, and when the DC will become active, this Default Quota will behave like any other regular quota but will still conceal a default flag in it.<BR>
When the user will edit the Default Quota, the quota will cease being Default, and the user will be forced to change the quota's name to a name without the "DefaultQuota-" prefix.<BR>
When the user will change the DC back to disabled, the existance of a Default Quota will be checked.<BR>
If a Default Quota exists (meaning that it was not edited while the DC was not disabled) no change will be performed on it, meaning all the new resources consumption will be taken from it.<BR>
If no Default Quota was found (meaning the Default Quota was edited while the DC was not disabled) then a new Default Quota will be created with a default name - DefaultQuota-NameOfTheDataCenter.

An administrator that would like to make the DC use Quota, should change the DC status to audit, which means the users can now have indications on the DC, but still be able to make actions on it.<BR> If the user will perform an action which exceeds the Quota capabilities perspective, a warning will be shown, but the operation will still succeed.

After the Administrator will finish configuring the Quotas he desires for the DC, he can set the DC to enforced status, which means users will be prevented from making actions which will exceed the Quota capabilities.<BR><BR>

==== Classes ====
'''Config Values'''<BR> New configuration values in vdc_options:
 ''quotaStorageThreshold'' - The default value should be 80%, and the version is General.<BR> Indicates the percentage of resource allocation, which beyond this (if Quota is enforced) would print an appropriate audit log message.<BR>
 ''quotaClusterThreshold'' - The default value should be 80%, and the version is General.<BR> Indicates the percentage of cluster allocation, which beyond this (if Quota is enforced) would print an appropriate audit log message.<BR>
 ''quotaStorageGrace'' - The default value should be 20%, and the version is General.<BR> Indicates the percentage of resource extension allocation.<BR>
 ''quotaClusterGrace'' - The default value should be 20%, and the version is General.<BR> Indicates the percentage of resource extension allocation.<BR>

'''DAO Classes'''<BR> 
'''''org.ovirt.engine.core.dao.QuotaDAO''''' - Interface for Quota DAO will extends GenericDao.<BR>
'''''org.ovirt.engine.core.dao.QuotaDAODbFacadeImpl''''' - Implementation for QuotaDAO, reflects the quota view implementations.

'''Classes'''<BR> 
'''''org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.QuotaManager''''' - Class which manage the quota views and memory delta tables
 ''quotaDeltaClusterMap'' - The quota cluster delta Map is a HashMap which reflects the delta changes being done on the DC before persistence, The update to the map should be synchronized.
 ''quotaStorageDeltaMap'' - The quota storage Map is a Concurrent HashMap which reflects the delta changes being done in the storage before persistence, the operation on it should be atomic.
'''''org.ovirt.engine.core.common.businessentities.QuotaStatusEnum''''' - Enum indicating the DC Quota verification status.

==== Query commands ====
'''''GetAllQuotaStoragesQuery''''' (Extends QueriesCommandBase) - Should call query (see [[Features/Design/Quota#DB Design|getAllQuotaStorageForSP]])<BR> with DC id and user id, The query will return List of all Quota for user in the DC.

===== Parameter commands =====
'''''GetAllQuotaStoragesParameters''''' - The parameter class will extend VdcQueryParametersBase, and will have the following fields : ... (TODO)

==== Scenarios ====
''Running VM'' - canDoAction

# Get DC verification status from quota_enforcement.
# If quota_enforcement != DISABLED
## Fetch Quota Id from VM dynamic
## Get quota cluster properties for quota ID, using the memory Map quotaClusterMap in [[Features/Design/Quota#Classes|QuotaManager]].
### Check the VM configuration against the free cluster space left in the Quota.
#### If VM capabilities are extending the free space left in the Quota
##### if the VM capabilities are extending extending 20% of the Quota space (Grace percent) then
###### If quota_enforcement is enforce
####### Fail the VM from running
####### Print an appropriate audit log.
###### else
####### Print an audit log warning message.
##### Else if the VM is extending the Quota limit but not extending the grace percent
###### Add Vm resources to Quota memory table quotaClusterMap.
###### Print an audit log of the User which caused the extension, and the extend details.
##### Else update quotaClusterMap.

Result : The VM will be already calculated in the memory table but this information will not be persistent in the DB until execute will performed.

''Running VM'' - execute

Each time there will be a change in the _asyncRunningVms (for example in createVMVdsCommand) the persistent Quota Dynamic data will be updated appropriately if needed<BR>
If the command will fail then the memory table should be decreased with the resources that were added to it.
<BR><BR><BR>

''Add New Disk - When dialog box opens''

# GUI will call the query command [[Features/Design/Quota#upgrade behaviour|GetAllQuotaStoragesQuery]] with DC UUID
# Return map of quotas, where each value represents a list of all the storage details.

''Add New Disk - Confirm dialog box''

# User will pick the quota and the domain, he wants the disk should be initialized on.
# If quota_enforcement != DISABLED
## Get quota storage properties for Quota ID, using the memory Map quotaStorageMap in [[Features/Design/Quota#Classes|QuotaManager]].
### If VM capabilities are extending the free space left in the Quota
#### if the VM capabilities are extending extending 20% of the Quota space (Grace percent) then
##### If quota_enforcement is enforce
###### Fail the operation.
###### Print an appropriate audit log.
##### else
###### Print an audit log warning message.
##### else if the VM is extending the Quota limit but not extending the grace percent
###### Validate and update the memory table.
####### Print an audit log of the User which caused the extension, and the extend details.
####### Execute the command
###### Execute the command

This logic in the canDoAction should be quite similar to the logic being done with StorageDomainSpaceChecker.

''Add new Disk - Confirm dialog box'' End Action
# At the end action we will check what was the storage change by GB, and update the Quota dynamic table appropriately.
<BR><BR><BR>

''Create new snapshot'' - CanDoAction
# Add the full disk size to the quotaStorageMap.

''Create new snapshot'' - End Action
# Get real size disk from VDSM of the snapshot created.
# Subtract from the memory table the following (fullSize - realSize)
# Update the DB quota dynamic value with + realSize

<BR><BR><BR>
''Create new template (similar to import scenario)'' - CanDoAction
# Calculate the storage that should be allocated by multiple the number of disks with 1GB (Which is the QCOW default size, TODO : Need to configure this with VDSM)
# validate the quota properties and update the memory table.

''Create new template (similar to import scenario)'' - EndAction
# Persist the changes in the DB.

<BR><BR><BR>
''Create/Edit VM'' - Reflects on AddVmCommand and EditVMCommand

# User will select Data Center he wants the VM to be created on.
# GUI will call the query GetQueryForStoragePool with DC UUID
# Call stored procedure GetAllQuotaClusterForSP with storage pool UUID and user ID.
# Call query Quotas_Attached_To_Storage_Pool with storage pool UUID and user ID.
# Get lists of business entity objects
# Return map of quotas, where each value represent a list of all the cluter details and the other should be all the users.
# Update the VM Dynamic with the Quota Id.

=== API Design ===

- Quotas are a new root entity, which can be viewed at: http://{host}:{port}/api/quotas
- Drill-down to the single quota level is possible. 

- Currently only basic quota meta-data is shown: 
  * name
  * description
  * data-center id
  * (quota limitations are not shown). 

- In all flows of creating/importing a VM or or a Disk, a quota ID may be passed. 

- If quota ID is not passed - the operation will fail in the Datacenter works with quotas (validation in the Backend). 



Add new command query GetQueryForStoragePool input - DC UUID output - All the Quotas for the DC.

== Tests ==
Storage tests.
Cluster tests

=== Expected unit-tests ===
# adding a new Quota
# running VM on Quota
# Adding a new Disk and attach to Quota
# Adding new snapshot
# Migrating VM

=== Special considerations ===
No special considerations.

=== Pre-integration needs ===
No needs.

== Design check list ==
This section describes issues that might need special consideration when writing this feature. Better sooner than later :-)

# Installer / Upgrader - Disk and Storage Pool should be attached to the default unlimited Quota.
# DB Upgrade - 
## For each DC, add Administrator Quota, which will be attached to all the users currently using the VM's in the DC.(see [[Features/Design/Quota#upgrade behaviour|upgrade logic]]) 
## Initialize the Quota users table depending on the users in the system.
# MLA - Remove user from the system should also remove the user from the Quota_users table
# Migrate
# Compatibility levels - The feature will be supported only for 2.3 VMs and up.
# Backward compatibility issues 
# API changes - new command queries for GUI and REST.
