= oVirt at FOSDEM 2014 =

There are a number of oVirt related activities during FOSDEM (the Free and Open Source Developers European Meeting) in Brussels, on February 1-2 2004.

First, there are a number of oVirt related presentations happening as part of the [//fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/virtualisation_and_iaas/  Virtualization and IaaS DevRoom]. See [[#Sessions | details on sessions]].

We will also have a stand for the project, and we would be happy to have oVirt community members come and help spread the love about oVirt there. Our stand will be in building K at level K1 (near the infodesk, between OpenStack and OpenShift).

Finally, we are going to [[#Social event | meet up for some drinks]] on Saturday evening in Brussels. You are welcome to come along to the bar "Au bon vieux temps", we'll be there from about 19h30 onwards.
