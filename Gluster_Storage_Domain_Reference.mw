==Suggested Gluster Volume Configuration for Storage Domain==
In order to use a gluster volume as an oVirt Storage Domain we suggest to:

* use the gluster replica 3 (three copies). See [https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Storage/2.1/html/Administration_Guide/sect-User_Guide-Setting_Volumes-Replicated.html Creating Replicated Volumes] guide
* set the network.ping-timeout to 10 seconds
* set the cluster.quorum-type to auto

Volume Info:

 Volume Name: (...)
 Type: Replicate
 Volume ID: (...)
 Status: Started
 Number of Bricks: 1 x 3 = 3
 Transport-type: tcp
 Bricks:
 (...three bricks...)
 Options Reconfigured:
 network.ping-timeout: 10
 cluster.quorum-type: auto

This configuration will prevent a split-brain on the files that are accessed in read-write mode from multiple hosts (e.g. sanlock ids file).

The commands used to configure the options are:

 # gluster volume set <volume_name> network.ping-timeout 10
 # gluster volume set <volume_name> cluster.quorum-type auto

Bug [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1066996 BZ#1066996] still generated in some cases a split-brain on sanlock files even with the proper configuration. It is suggested to use a gluster build where this bug is solved (when it will be available).
