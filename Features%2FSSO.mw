== The challenge ==

Acquire ability to automatically login a user into the console of a virtual machine.

Console login is assumed to be local, there is no standard way to pass credential via a protocol as no network is involved.

There are solution to automate the login process via API, this implies that with cooperation of a component running on system it is possible to automate the login process.

== Why don't we use the network login capabilities of the system? ==

In theory there should be no need to hijack remote system console, as every modern operating system supports remote login protocol and graphics redirection.

In practice there are no mature Windows based solutions for graphics redirection leveraging the local and remote GPUs.

Within Linux using ssh + x11 + mesa is possible, but is somewhat difficult to establish, as X11 does not support multiple window managers.

The other challenge is to reach virtual machine user interface via network protocol when there is no network available or via side-band, this can be solved by tunneling stream over virtual io channel into localhost at specific port, for example ssh.

== Current oVirt Implementation (3.3) ==

Automatic login is enabled only in user portal.

Automatic login is always enabled in user portal for VMs that run guest agent.

The domain, user and password that it used are the credentials used to login into the web interface.

# User login into ovirt-engine user portal.
# User request graphical session to a VM within user portal.
# ovirt-engine generates random "ticket".
# ovirt-engine via vdsm sends the ticket to qemu with hard coded validity period of 120 seconds.
# ovirt-egnine via vdsm sends desktop login command along with domain, user, password to guest agent running within the virtual machine, this is done via the side band vdsm<->guest agent channel.
# guest agent uses the credentials to automate login sequence using one of various methods.
# ovirt-engine trigger execution of spice/vnc at client machine passing the ticket.
# spice/vnc at client connects to qemu passing the ticket and establish connection.
# when spice/vnc session disconnects qemu will issue disconnection event to vdsm.
# vdsm sends lock-screen command to guest agent.
# vdsm will revive ticket so it will be valid again in case of virtual migration, to enable client re-connection.
<br/>
* in case of webscoket proxy another ticket is issued signed by engine key and validated against engine public key at websocket proxy, ticket contains destination ip and port to establish communication with.

=== Guest agent commands ===

Available more commands than actually used.

* refresh - Send misc information back.
* login - Perform login, triggered by engine command, can also be used to unlock. Accepts: username[@domain], password
* lock-screen - Lock console, used by:
*# vdsm save vm state sequence (before saving).
*# libvirt event GRAPHICS phase: GRAPHICS_DISCONNECT
* log-off - Force logoff user from console, triggered by engine command, not actually used anywhere.
* shutdown - Gracefully shutdown system, used by vdsm VM shutdown sequence before using other more intrusive means.

== Problems in current implementations ==

* Inability to support single signon or non password based authentication (example: OpenID) <p>The assumption that the password used to login into the ovirt web interface is available or can be used in order to login into guest is incorrect. Authentication using kerberos, SSL certificate, OpenID or any password based SSO will not provide usable password to the engine.</p>
* Always enable automatic login when guest agent is available may cause user lockout <p>If password on guest differs, the lock reference of the user will be incremented at any attempt.</p>
* Webadmin does not support automatic login
* No mutual authentication between client and virtual machine <p>The user credentials are passed directly to VM using the engine->vdsm channel, the user login takes place without even the user is involved. User does not need to connect to the VM in order to establish login.</p>
* vdsm<->guest agent protocol does not support negotiation<p>No protocol version is exchanged between components, components are unaware of what features are supported by peer.</p>
* vdsm<->guest protocol does not support peer restart message <p>If vdsm is restarted (upgraded for example) or guest agent is restarted (upgraded for example) the peer do not know of the event in order to enable new features or handle state pull.</p>
* websocket proxy does not use SSL protocol toward qemu<p>Should be solved separately.</p>
* The guest agent uses thread to send periodic status but does not use locking, so channel may become corrupted<p>Should be solved separately.</p>

== Requirements ==

# Establish single signin friendly environment.
# Provide Linux end-to-end and firefox based solution of kerberos based end-to-end SSO.
# Decouple solution from oVirt specific implementation as much as possible.
# Windows guests are out of scope for now, there are multiple issues with Windows as CredSSP[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc226764.aspx] violates SSO by require access to user's master password, and there is no [documented] way to load TGT into LSA.

== Proposed solution ==

=== Outline ===

Create a channel between client and guest and transfer credentials using stream protocol on top of the channel. The protocol may be based on SASL to exchange credentials information.

This solution can be used outside of the oVirt project scope, so it should be relatively easy to push missing bits into spice upstream.

===== Preparations =====

* mod_auth_kerb5 is installed at engine to enable kerberos SSO.
* Issue kerberos credentials to all VMs.

=== Components' major changes ===

==== <b>Spice client (method#1)</b> ====

* Establish/leverage a new virtual device interface to hold credentials blob, accessible by target host.
* Add API and command-line parameter to accept blob as file and make it available to target host.
The format of the blob should not be important to the implementation.

NOTE: this infrastructure change will work in non-oVirt configurations as long as there is a cooperative component running on target OS.

==== <b>Spice client (method#2)</b> ====

* Establish/leverage a new virtual device interface to hold credentials blob, accessible by target hist.
* Add API and command-line parameter to enable kerberos credentials forward.
* Add API and command-line optional parameter of credentials encryption key.
* Define format of credentials blob, example: json format with salt, timestamp, credentials type (user, password, TGT), credentials blob encoded as base64.
* Optionally encrypt the credentials blob using the provided key.

NOTE: this infrastructure change will work in non-oVirt configurations as long as there is a cooperative component running on target OS.

==== <b>Spice client (method#3)</b> ====

* Implement SASL VDI - enables SASL negotiation on top of virtual serial or any other stream device.
* Parameters (or command-line):
** Optional: Remote service principal name.
** Trust any service principal name (disabled per default)
** Offer TGT to untrusted for delegation services (disabled per default).
** Optional: User/password.
* If remote service principal name is provided, request ticket to that service name.
* If remote service principal name is not provided, ask remote for its service principal name, prompt user for approval before continue.
* Perform SASL negotiation with TGT delegation.
* if fails and "Offer TGT to untrusted for delegation services" is enabled perform SASL negotiation without TGT delegation, send TGT.
* If has no TGT prompt the user for user, password and send to host.

NOTE: this infrastructure change will work in non-oVirt configurations as long as there is a cooperative component running on target OS.

==== <b>vnc client</b> ====

The encrypted credentials blob visibility to target host should be implemented in similar way to spice.

==== <b>virt-viewer (method#1, method#2)</b> ====

Support the new spice credentials blob feature, enable passing key/blob via command line or within configuration file.

==== <b>virt-viewer (method#3)</b> ====

* Support of loading and configuring the SASL VDI.

==== <b>vdsm</b> ====

* Forward libvirt GRAPHICS event phase INITIALIZE into new guest agent 'client-connect' command.

Optional:
* Add version command vdsm->guest agent with minimum and maximum supported versions.
* Add version command guest agent->vdsm with minimum and maximum supported versions.
* If not received assumes version=0 (current) is supported
* Add connect vdsm->guest agent command to be used when vdsm is started.
* Add connect guest agent->vdsm command to be used when guest agent is started.
* Add command to return guest agent protocol version of an active vm to engine so engine be aware of new features availability.

Note: Sending unknown commands in current implementation will issue error within logs of both components, no other side effect.

==== <b>vdsm (method#1, method#2)</b> ====

* Forward credentials encrypted blob into new guest 'credentials-key' command.
* Expose API command to allow engine feed credentials key to a vm.

==== <b>vdsm (method#3)</b> ====

* Add 'get-spn' command.

==== <b>guest agent (method#1, method#2)</b> ====

* If 'credentials-key' is received store encryption key.
* If 'client-connect' is received communicate with the VDI to acquire the encrypted blob, if encrypted, decrypt using the credentials key. NOTE: we support plain text credentials as well.
* If blob contains TGT validate TGT and extract user, perform local authentication without password and make TGT available to user.
* If blob contains user,password extract user and password and perform current logic.
* If console is locked, user must patch current logged on user.

==== <b>guest agent (method#3)</b> ====

* Add get-spn command to return service principal name of guest agent.
* If 'client-connect' is received try to detect SASL VDI.
* If SASL VDI device is detected
** perform SASL negotiation.
** If success try to extract delegated TGT.
** If no delegated TGT ask client for TGT over SASL.
** If SASL fails ask for user/password.
** If TGT available, validate TGT and extract user, perform local authentication without password and make TGT available to user.
** If user, password available perform current logic.
* If console is locked, user must patch current logged on user.

==== <b>ovirt-engine (method#1)</b> ====

* If kerberos SSO is enabled.
* Acquire user's TGT from http servlet request attributes.
* Generate key and encrypt TGT, send key instead of user/password to guest agent via vdsm.

==== <b>ovirt-engine (method#2)</b> ====

* If kerberos SSO is enabled.
* Generate key, send key instead of user/password to guest agent via vdsm.
* Send key to virtvieweer instructing it to use it and send encrypted kerberos credentials.

==== <b>ovirt-engine (method#3)</b> ====

* If kerberos SSO is enabled.
* Acquire VM machine service principal name via guest agent.
* Send key to service principal name instructing it to enable the SASL VDI.

==== <b>ovirt-engine (method#1 future)</b> ====

* Enable pluggable creation of the blob, to support non kerberos SSO technologies.
