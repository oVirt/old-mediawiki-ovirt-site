=== Detailed Description ===
In oVirt, after a VM network is defined in the Data Center level and added to a cluster, it needs to be implemented on each host. All VM networks are (currently) based on a Linux software bridge. The specific implementation controls how traffic from that bridge reaches the outer world. For example, the bridge may be connected externally via <tt>eth3</tt>, or <tt>bond3</tt> over <tt>eth2</tt> and <tt>p1p2</tt>. This feature is about implementing a network with no network interfaces (NICs) at all.

Having a disconnected network may first seem to add complexity to VM placement. Until now, we assumed that if a network (say, ''blue'') is defined on two hosts, the two hosts lie in the same broadcast domain. If a couple of VMs are connected to ''blue'' it does not matter where they a run - they would always hear each other. This is of course no longer true if one of the hosts implements ''blue'' as nicless. However, this is nothing new. oVirt never validates the single broadcast domain assumption, which can be easily broken by an admin: on one host, an admin can implement ''blue'' using a nic that has completely unrelated physical connectivity.


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
* [[Feature/AllInOne|All-in-One]] use case: we'd like to have an oVirt complete deployment that does not rely on external resources, such as layer-2 connectivity or DNS.
* Collaborative computing: an oVirt user may wish to have a group of VMs with heavy in-group secret communication, where only one of the VMs exposes an external web service. The in-group secret communication could be limited to a nic-less network, no need to let it spill outside.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->

==== Vdsm ====
Vdsm already supports defining a network with no nics attached.

==== Engine ====
I am told that implementing this in Engine is quite a pain, as network external interfaces are currently used as keys. A network without nics is currently unsearchable.
