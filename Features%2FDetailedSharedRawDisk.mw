== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Provide the details of the feature. What is it going to include. See the sections below. -->
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->
The shared disk feature should provide the ability to attach a disk to multiple VMs. It is the user's responsibility to make sure that the VMs do not corrupt disk data.<BR>
Users should be able to easily manage disks as standalone entities which are not shared between VMs (see http://www.ovirt.org/wiki/Features/FloatingDisk),<BR> or as entities which are shared between multiple VMs, and be able to switch between the two states.
This feature will enable oVirt users to more easily run external cluster applications, or shared data warehouses on VMs.

=== Entity Description ===

==== Disk ====
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->
* Disk should have a field indicating whether it is shared or not.

=== Functionality ===
General
* Currently only Raw disks can be shared
* The synchronization/clustering of data access to shared disks is the responsibility of the guests. Attaching a shared disk to non-cluster aware guests will lead to corruption of the data on the disk.
* Shared disks are attached with R/W permissions.
* When detaching a disk from all VMs in the Data Center., the disk will become 'floating' 
Attach Shared Disk
* When attaching a shared disk to a VM, by default the disk will be logically connected to the VM but it will be 'unplugged'.  To make the disk 'visible' to the guest, the user will have to explicitly 'plug' the disk.
* Shared raw disk is configured the same as a regular disk, but with a shared flag marked as true.
Remove Shared Disk
* The shared raw disk can only be removed once it is either unplugged from all VMs to which it is attached or these VMs are all shut down (or any combination of the two).
Copy Shared Disk
* The shared raw disk can only be copied once it is either unplugged from all VMs to which it is attached or these VMs are all shut down (or any combination of the two).
Templates
* When creating a template from a VM which has one or more shared disks, the shared disks will not be part of the resulting template.
* Template disks should not be shared.
* VM disks which are thinly provisioned, should not be referenced as shared raw disk.
Export/Import
* When exporting a VM, only the disks which are not shared will be exported.
Move disk
* Moving a shared raw disk is permitted only when all the attached VMs statuses are down, or all the disks which are attached to active VMs are unplugged.
Move VM
* When moving a VM the shared raw disk should not be moved.
Snapshot
* when taking a vm snapshot, a snapshot of the shared disk will not be taken.
Stateless VM
* When running stateless VM, the shared raw disk will not be handled as stateless, the user should get a warning message indicating that the disk will not be handled as stateless.
VM pools
* Since VM from pool is stateless, The same behaviour as stateless VM should be implemented here. shared raw disk will not be stateless in a stateless VM, and a warning message will be performed.

=== User Experience ===
<!-- Describe user experience related issues. For example: We need a wizard for ...., the behaviour is different in the UI because ....., etc. -->
<!-- GUI mockups should also be added here to make it more clear -->
* Display shared disk
** The shared disks will be displayed in the 'disks' main tab.
** The shared disk details tab will include the number of VMs to which it is connected.
* Adding shared disk
** Creating/Editing a shared disk is available through the new/edit disk dialog from the disks sub tab in the VM main tab.<BR> The add/edit disk dialog box will have a check box indicating the disk is shared or not.<BR/>When a user wants to configure a regular disk to be shared disk, he will edit the disk and mark the checkbox as shared.
** User can also attach/detach shared disk through the disks sub tab of the VMs main tab, 
** The administrator can attach/detach shared raw disk from the disks main tab.
* Delete shared disk
** User will be able to delete a shared disk from the disks sub tab in the VMs sub tab.

=== Installation/Upgrade ===
<!-- Describe how the feature will effect new installation or existing one. -->
* Disk name should be calculated automatically counting on the vm name and disk number in the VM. Description will be empty.
* New disk should enforce the user to enter a name for the disk.

=== User work-flows ===
<!-- Describe the high-level work-flows relevant to this feature. -->
The Administrator Portal should allow the following operations:
* User will be able to view all shared raw disks from the disks main tab.
* Regular disk can become a shared raw disk, by editing the existing disk and mark the share disk property type.
* When removing a VM with shared raw disk attached to it, the shared disk will not be deleted.
* If no other VMs are being attached to the shared disk then it will become floating disk.
* Attach/Detach of shared raw disk can be performed only when the VM is in status down.
* Shared raw disk must be formatted with raw type, and does not support OS disks (system bootable disks).

The Power User Portal should allow the following operations:
* Attach, detach disks to VM.
* View shared disks in the Data Center which the power user can attach/detach
* The power user will not have permissions to create a shared disk from the user portal.


The following UI mockups contain guidelines for the different screens and wizards:

== Dependencies / Related Features and Projects ==
<!-- What other packages (RPMs) depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? Add a link to the feature description for relevant features. -->
Attaching shared disk will not consume new Quota resource.
Affected oVirt projects:
* API
* CLI
* Engine-core
* Webadmin
* User Portal

Quota has to be taken in consideration, for every new feature that will involve consumption of resources managed by it.<BR/>
Floating disk  - Shared raw disk will be considered to be floating when the shared disk will not be attach to any VM.
