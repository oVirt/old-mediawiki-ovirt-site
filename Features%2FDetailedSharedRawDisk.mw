== Current status ==
* Target Release: 
* Status: Design Stage
* Last updated date: Wed November 10 2011


== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Provide the details of the feature. What is it going to include. See the sections below. -->
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->
The shared raw disk feature should provide the ability to attach disk to many VMs with safe concurrent access,<BR>
The disk should behave as a flexible independent entity, that can be reflected as a standalone entity that is not shared between VMs(see http://www.ovirt.org/wiki/Features/FloatingDisk),<BR> or as a shared entity between multiple of VMs,.
With this feature oVirt will be more compatible to support external cluster application, or shared data warehouse.

=== Entity Description ===

==== Disk ====
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->
* Disk should have an indication field for shared/not shared disk.

=== Functionality ===
* The synchronization/clustering of shared raw disk between VMs will be managed in the file system.
* Each VM which has attached shared raw disk, can R/W to the shared raw disk.
* Shared raw disk will become floating disk when the disk will not be attached to any VMs in the Data Center.
* Shared raw disk can be moved from one VM to another. 
* Shared raw disk is configured the same as a regular disk, but with a shared flag marked as true.
* The shared raw disk can be removed if all the VMs that are using it are in status down or VMs which are in status up but the shared raw disk is unplugged.
Templates
* When creating a template from a VM which one of its disks are shared, the shared raw disk will not be part of the template creation.
* Template disks can not be shared.
Export/Import
* Export VM, will export only VM disks which are not shared.
Move disk
* Moving a shared raw disk is permitted only when all the attached VMs status are down.
Move VM
* When moving a VM the shared raw disk should not be moved.
Snapshot
* when taking a vm snapshot, a snapshot of the shared disk will not be taken.
Stateless VM
* When running stateless VM, the shared raw disk will not be handle as stateless.

=== User Experience ===
<!-- Describe user experience related issues. For example: We need a wizard for ...., the behaviour is different in the UI because ....., etc. -->
<!-- GUI mockups should also be added here to make it more clear -->
* Display shared disk
** The shared disks will be displayed in the 'disks' main tab.
* Adding shared disk
** Creating/Editing a shared raw disk is available through the new/edit disk dialog from the disks sub tab in the VM main tab.<BR> The add/edit disk dialog box will have a check box indicating the disk is shared or not.<BR/>When a user wants to configure a regular disk to be shared disk, he will edit the disk and mark the checkbox as shared.
** User can also attach/detach shared disk through the disks sub tab of the VMs main tab, 
** The administrator can attach/detach shared raw disk from the disks main tab.
* Delete shared disk
** User will be able to delete a shared disk from the disks sub tab in the VMs sub tab.

=== Installation/Upgrade ===
<!-- Describe how the feature will effect new installation or existing one. -->
* Disk name should be calculated automatically counting on the vm name and disk number in the VM. the creation date should be the day of the upgrade, and the description will be "Automatically generated disk name".
* New disk should enforce the user to enter a name and description for the disk.

=== User work-flows ===
<!-- Describe the high-level work-flows relevant to this feature. -->
The Administrator Portal should allow the following operations:
* User will be able to view all shared raw disks from the disks main tab.
* Regular disk can become a shared raw disk, by editing the existing disk and mark the share disk property type.
* When removing a VM with shared raw disk attached to it, the shared disk will not be deleted.
* If no other VMs are being attached to the shared disk then it will become floating disk.
* Attach/Detach of shared raw disk can be performed only when the VM is in status down.
* Shared raw disk must be formatted with raw type, and does not support OS disks (system bootable disks).

The Power User Portal should allow the following operations:
* Attach, detach disks to VM.
* View shared disks in the Data Center which the power user can attach/detach
* The power user will not have permissions to create a shared disk from the user portal.


The following UI mockups contain guidelines for the different screens and wizards:

== Dependencies / Related Features and Projects ==
<!-- What other packages (RPMs) depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? Add a link to the feature description for relevant features. -->
Attaching shared disk will not consume new Quota resource.
Affected oVirt projects:
* API
* CLI
* Engine-core
* Webadmin
* User Portal

Quota has to be taken in consideration, for every new feature that will involve consumption of resources managed by it.<BR/>
Floating disk  - Shared raw disk will be considered to be floating when the shared disk will not be attach to any VM.
