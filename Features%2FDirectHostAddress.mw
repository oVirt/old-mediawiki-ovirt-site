----

== Summary ==

== Current status ==
* Status: Design

== Detailed Description ==
When adding a host, admin sets the host address. The engine uses this address to manage the host in two ways. The first is via SSH for host installation, and the second is via xml-rpc for any other action.
Current behaviour assumes the network interface with the specified address is configured properly in the engine although this may not be the case initially.

The direct IP address will be optional, and when not specified by the admin, it will be set to the same address as the regular host address.

== Design ==
=== Engine ===
A new column will be added to the vds_static table:
{|class="wikitable sortable"
!border="1"| Column Name ||Column Type ||Null? / Default ||Description 
|-
|direct_ip || VARCHAR(255) ||  ||the host's direct IP address
|-
|}

==== API Changes ====
The tag <direct_address> will be added to the host resource /api/hosts/{host:id}:

    <host id="56d6d62f-6af0-4c02-8500-4be041180031">
        ...
        <address>10.35.1.160</address>
        <direct_address>10.35.1.162</address>
        ...
    </host>

==== UI Changes ====
A new textbox named "Direct Address" in both the add and edit host dialogs will be added (in red):
