== Adding External Health Status to oVirt Entities==

=== Summary ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
Provide a mechanism to set entity health status which will be displayed in the UI as follows

 Info
 Warning
 Critical
 Failure

The Health Status field will be returned as part of the retrieved entity when a call to display the entity is done using the REST API.

The main use-case for this new status is to provide plugins / external systems the ability to trigger issues, and allow the administrator to clearly see there is an issue through the UI

The first entities that will be implemented are Host and Storage Domain

=== Owner ===

<!-- Include you email address that you can be reached should people want to contact you about helping with your feature, status is requested, or  technical issues need to be resolved-->

=== Current status ===
<!--* Link to feature page in a specific release. That release may complete the feature, or parts of it. The complete scope of this feature in this release will be described in the release feature page -->
Currently oVirt provides only an internal status of the host which is controlled internally by oVirt<br>
In order to see problems on an entity, the administrator should go and select each entity and then look in the relevant plug-in sub-tab for the entity.
There is no visual marker for indicating problems on the entity that were reported by an external system

=== Use Case ===
<!--* Link to feature page in a specific release. That release may complete the feature, or parts of it. The complete scope of this feature in this release will be described in the release feature page -->
An external system indicates a problem on an entity instance and wants to set its health status such that this status is displayed and visible immediately to the application administrator in the entity main view without any need to drill-down to each and every entity.  The administrator will see in the main grid that there is an issue, and pressing on the specific entity he will either be able to look at the events sub-tab to understand what the issue is, or look at custom sub-tab provided by the plugin (if there is indeed a plugin in this specific use-case).

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->

The goal is to enable to add each entity a Health Status field which can be set and retrieved using the REST API<br>
The UI should include this field for each such entity main view and displayed it graphically with the appropriate color according to the reported status

This will be achieved by adding a Health Status field to each relevant entity which can be set by a command on the entity instance 
The command parameters should have parameters that enables oVirt to generate an implicit External Event for the status transition

For the first phase the supported entities will be : Host and Storage Domain
vds_dynamic and storage_domain_dynamic tables will have an addition health column DB Facade objects, BEs and tests will be updated accordingly 

on REST API those entities will retrieve the health as well , for example a GET on

<dir>/api/82d9f776-12cf-437a-b686-5958d09f9eb4<br>
results with :

  <host id=................>
      ......
      ......
      <externalstatus>ok</externalstatus>
   </host>

Setting the status for a entity will be done via the External Events mechanism with an additional externalstatus elemet under the entity 
For example 

  <event>
    <description>The heat of the host is above 30 Oc</description>
    <severity>warning</severity>
    <origin>HP Openview</origin>
    <custom_id>1</custom_id>
    <flood_rate>30</flood_rate>
    <host id="82d9f776-12cf-437a-b686-5958d09f9eb4" >
      <externalstatus>warning<externalstatus>
    </host>
  </event>

Another example for storage domains and when the external status and the event severity is diffrent :

  <event>
    <description>No space left on device</description>
    <severity>error</severity>
    <origin>XXX</origin>
    <custom_id>1</custom_id>
    <flood_rate>30</flood_rate>
    <storagedomain id="73d9f776-12cf-437a-b686-5958d09f9ec5" >
      <externalstatus>failure<externalstatus>
    </storagedomain>
  </event>

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->

Enabeling to see problems that were reported by external systems in the entity main view at the point in time those problems occur
