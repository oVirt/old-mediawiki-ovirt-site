== Adding External Health Status to oVirt Entities==

=== Summary ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
Provide a mechanism to set entity health status by plug-ins which will be displayed in the UI as follows

OK (Green) 
Info (Blue) 
Warning (Yellow) 
Critical (Orange) 
Failure (Red) 

The Healt Status sield will be returned as part of the retrieved entity when a call to display the entity is done using the RST API

=== Current status ===
<!--* Link to feature page in a specific release. That release may complete the feature, or parts of it. The complete scope of this feature in this release will be described in the release feature page -->
Currently oVirt provides only an internal status of the host which is controled internally by oVirt<br>
In order to see problems on an entity, the adminisrator should go and select each entity and then look in the relevant plug-in sub-tab for the entity.
There is no visual marker for indicating problems on the entity that were reported by an external system


=== Use Case ===
<!--* Link to feature page in a specific release. That release may complete the feature, or parts of it. The complete scope of this feature in this release will be described in the release feature page -->
An external system having a oVirt UI plug-in on a entity managed by ovirt indicates a problem on an entity instance and wants to set its health status such that this status is displayed and visible immediatly to the application administrator in the entity main view withot any need to drill-down

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->

The goal is to enable to add each entity a Health Status field which can be set and retrieved using the REST API<br>
The UI should include this field for each such entity main view and displayed it graphically with the appropriate color according to the reported status

This will be achieved by adding a Health Status field to each relevant entity which can be set by a command on the entity instance 
The command parameters should have parameters that enables oVirt to generate an implicit External Event for the status transition

For the first phase the supported entities will be : Host and Storage Domain
vds_dynamic and storage_domain_dynamic tables will have an addition health column DB Facade objects, BEs and tests will be updated accordingly 

on REST API those entities will retrieve the health as well , for example a GET on

<dir>/api/82d9f776-12cf-437a-b686-5958d09f9eb4<br>
results with :

  <host id=................>
      ......
      ......
      <health>ok</health>
   </host>

to set the status for a host, there will be a separate command 
   <dir>/api/hosts/82d9f776-12cf-437a-b686-5958d09f9eb4/setHealthStatus
    
the body will look like 

  <action>
    <health>warning</health>
    <description>Heat of CPU reached 40</description>
    <severity>normal</severity>
    <origin>XXX</origin>
    <custom_id>1</custom_id>
    <flood_rate>30</flood_rate>
  </action>

This will set the status on the 82d9f776-12cf-437a-b686-5958d09f9eb4 host to warning and will generate implicitly an external events as the following 

  <event>
    <description>Heat of CPU reached 40</description>
    <severity>warning</severity>
    <origin>XXX</origin>
    <custom_id>1</custom_id>
    <flood_rate>30</flood_rate>
    <host id="82d9f776-12cf-437a-b686-5958d09f9eb4" />
  </event>

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->

Enabeling to see problems that were reported by external systems in the entity main view at the point in time those problems occur
