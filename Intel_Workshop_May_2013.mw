Ovirt strives to become the first and best truly open and comprehensive data center virtualization management suite.  As the oVirt community is rapidly evolving and growing one of the ways we look to connect is through oVirt Workshops around the globe.  
The May 2013 oVirt workshop will be held at [https://maps.google.com/maps?q=No.+880+Zi+Xing+Road+Zizhu+Science+Park+Minhang,+Shanghai+200241+China&hl=en&sll=23.141807,113.324834&sspn=0.077662,0.153122&t=h&hq=No.+880+Zi+Xing+Road+Zizhu+Science+Park+Minhang,+Shanghai+200241+China&radius=15000&z=13 Intel's Shanghai Campus].  This workshop will be designed to encourage collaboration in our community, as well as help answer questions about the project from both a developer and user's perspective.  Slides will be made available here prior to the event.  We look forward to seeing you there!
