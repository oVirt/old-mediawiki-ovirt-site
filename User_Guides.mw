== Source Control ==

The documentation subproject has a git repository. Like the other oVirt git repositories it is managed using Gerrit. Follow the [[Working_with_gerrit.ovirt.org|instructions for registering with and using Gerrit]], then use the git clone command to get a local copy of the repository:

 $ git clone gerrit.ovirt.org:ovirt-docs

The git repository is intended to be used for the creation and maintenance of formal documentation for the project. At this time all formal documentation for the project is written in DocBookXML and turned into PDF, HTML, HTML-SINGLE, and EPUB output using [https://fedorahosted.org/publican/ publican].

== Brand ==

The [http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=6970 publican-ovirt] brand is used to build the oVirt documentation. It is recommended that before building oVirt documentation you download and install this brand to ensure consistent theming.

Built packages for Fedora 15, 16, and 17 are available for download in [http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=6970 koji]. These are also expected to work on RHEL and derivative operating systems. The source to the brand is available in the upstream [http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=publican.git;a=tree;f=publican-ovirt;h=3d2102770380957804b86a543d4d021e816c20f7;hb=HEAD publican git repository].
