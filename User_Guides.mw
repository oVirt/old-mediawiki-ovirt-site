== Source Control ==

The documentation subproject has a git repository. Like the other oVirt git repositories it is managed using Gerrit. Follow the [[Working_with_gerrit.ovirt.org|instructions for registering with and using Gerrit]], then use the git clone command to get a local copy of the repository:

 $ git clone gerrit.ovirt.org:ovirt-docs

The git repository is intended to be used for the creation and maintenance of formal documentation for the project. At this time all formal documentation for the project is written in DocBookXML and turned into PDF, HTML, HTML-SINGLE, and EPUB output using [https://fedorahosted.org/publican/ publican].

== Brand ==

The [http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=6970 publican-ovirt] brand is used to build the oVirt documentation. It is recommended that before building oVirt documentation you download and install this brand to ensure consistent theming. Users of Fedora 15, Fedora 16, and Fedora 17, may obtain the brand by running:

    # yum install publican-brand

Alternatively the RPMs are available for download in [http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=6970 koji]. These are also expected to work on RHEL and derivative operating systems. 

Users of other operating systems for which publican is available may obtain the source to the brand from the [http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=publican.git;a=tree;f=publican-ovirt;h=3d2102770380957804b86a543d4d021e816c20f7;hb=HEAD publican git repository]. Once a local copy of the brand source has been created, follow the instructions in the [http://jfearn.fedorapeople.org/en-US/Publican/2.6/html/Users_Guide/chap-Users_Guide-Branding.html#sect-Users_Guide-Installing_a_brand Publican User Guide] to build and install the brand.
