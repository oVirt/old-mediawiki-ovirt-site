== Source Control ==

The documentation subproject has a git repository. Like the other oVirt git repositories it is managed using Gerrit. You can get a copy of the repository using the git clone command to the read-only git server:

 $ git clone git://gerrit.ovirt.org/ovirt-docs

To make changes and submit patches for the project, you should first follow the [[Working with oVirt Gerrit | instructions for registering with and using Gerrit]], then use the following git clone command to get a local copy of the repository:

 $ git clone gerrit.ovirt.org:ovirt-docs

The git repository is intended to be used for the creation and maintenance of formal documentation for the project. At this time all formal documentation for the project is written in DocBookXML and turned into PDF, HTML, HTML-SINGLE, and EPUB output using [https://fedorahosted.org/publican/ publican].

== Installing Publican ==

=== Fedora 15 / 16 / 17 ===

Publican is packaged for Fedora and can be installed with:

 # yum install publican

=== Debian / Ubuntu ===

Publican is packaged for Debian and can be installed with:

 # apt-get install publican

== Installing the oVirt Brand ==

Publican allows you to create your own consistent look and feel across documentation, by using packages called [http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora_Contributor_Documentation/1/html/Users_Guide/chap-Users_Guide-Branding.html "brands"]. When a "brand" is specifed in the *publican.cfg* file for a guide, Publican uses it when building the guide to set the look and feel of the output.

The [http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=6970 publican-ovirt] brand is used to style the oVirt documentation. It is recommended that before building oVirt documentation you download and install this brand to ensure consistent theming. Users of Fedora 15, Fedora 16, and Fedora 17, may obtain the brand by running:

    # yum install publican-ovirt

This will install the stylesheets and images that make up the oVirt brand. Alternatively the RPMs are available for download in [http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=6970 koji]. These are also expected to work on RHEL and derivative operating systems. 

Users of other operating systems for which publican is available may obtain the source to the brand from the [http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=publican.git;a=tree;f=publican-ovirt;h=3d2102770380957804b86a543d4d021e816c20f7;hb=HEAD publican git repository]. Once a local copy of the brand source has been created, follow the instructions in the [http://jfearn.fedorapeople.org/en-US/Publican/2.6/html/Users_Guide/chap-Users_Guide-Branding.html#sect-Users_Guide-Installing_a_brand Publican User Guide] to build and install the brand.

Once you have the brand installed, you can build the installation guide with the following commands:

 $ cd ovirt-docs/Installation_Guide
 $ publican build --formats xml,pdf,html,epub --langs all --publish

This will generate the documentation in the directory "publish" in each of the formats specified. For further information on Publican, and how to install documentation system-wide, refer to the [http://jfearn.fedorapeople.org/en-US/Publican/2.0/html/Users_Guide/index.html Publican user guide].
