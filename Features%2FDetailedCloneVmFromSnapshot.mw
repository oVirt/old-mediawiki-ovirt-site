== Clone VM from Snapshot ==

=== Summary ===
The feature will allow oVirt users to clone VM (or a VM template) from a snapshot of another VM. <BR>
A clone from snapshot will create disks at destination VM that are a collapsed copy of the images at snapshot chain (the start of the chain is the first snapshot, the end of the chain is a the selected snapshot) <BR>

=== Current status ===
* Target Release: ...
* Status: In progress 
* Last updated date: Jan 18th, 2012


=== Detailed Description ===
Clone from Snapshot will give the ability to perform a clone of a VM or a VM template , based on a snapshot of a given VM. <BR> 
oVirt-engine core will copy and collapse the images in the snapshot chain (the chain begins with the 1st snapshot, and ends with the selected snapshot). <BR><BR>
In order to provide information on the VM or VM template to be created for the UI, UI will execute a query that will retrieve the VM and its disks configuration given a snapshot ID. <BR>
The UI will use the retrieved configuration as default values for the user to be modified. <BR>

==== Entity Description ====

==== CRUD ====

==== User Experience ====
<!-- Describe user experience related issues. For example: We need a wizard for ...., the behaviour is different in the UI because ....., etc. -->
<!-- GUI mockups should also be added here to make it more clear -->
The UI will run a query called GetVmConfigurationBySnapshotID in order to get a VM configuration for a given snapshot. <BR>
The UI will provide two options for creating the clone:
.1. Presenting resent a window holding the configuration data. The configuration data will be used as defaults for the user, and the user may alter the data.<BR>
The UI will also present the disk list in order to allow disk format and type, and to select different storage domains to hold the destination disks.<BR><BR>
2. The UI will allow the user to enter the target VM (or template) name, and the clone operation will use the VM configuration for the given snapshot as the values to create the VM (or template).

Example of flow (assuming a VM was created with two disks): <BR>
[[File:Clone flow 1.jpg]]<BR>
The next figure shows a snapshot was made, having now two images serving as the active images: <BR>

<BR>[[File:Clone flow 2.jpg]]<BR>
In a similar way, more snapshots are created (Snaphost2 will be the one used for performing the clone): <BR>
<BR>[[File:Clone flow 3.jpg]]<BR>


The Clone from snapshot will be performed the following way: <BR><BR>

.1. A user selects snapshot2 and selects a "clone from snapshot" operation from UI. <BR>
.2. oVirt-engine core queries for VM configuration, providing the VM configuration as default values for the user to use in order to provide the new VM information. <BR>
.3. The user will override the default data values (the user will have to provide a new name. UI will suggest a new name in a format of "copy_of_OLD_NAME") <BR>
.4. The user will initiate the beginning of the clone operation.<BR>
.5. New VM entity based on the passed data will be created. Some VM related data will be cloned from the original VM (i.e NICs) <BR>
.6. Copy & collapse all images at snaphsot2 and their ancestors will be carried out by oVirt-engine<BR>
.7. Association the copies of the disks with the VM clone will be created<BR><BR>

This can be seen in the next figure:<BR>

==== Events ====
1. In case a snapshot is performed , and one of the disks is erased from the original VM, cloning from the snapshot 
should report that the disk is missing using the audit log.

=== Dependencies / Related Features and Projects ===

The feature depends on the following projects: <BR>
1. oVirt web-admin - to supply the UI parts for this feature <BR>
2. oVirt API - to supply REST modeling <BR><BR>
The feature depends on the following features: <BR>
1. Stable device addresses - on introduction of VM devices, which will have to be a part of the clone. See also [[Features/Design/StableDeviceAddresses]] <BR>
2. Multiple storage domains - on introduction of multiple storage domains. When performing the clone the user should be able to select the storage domains containing the disks of the cloned VM. See also [[Design_for_multiple_storage_domains]] <BR>
3. Live snapshots - on introducing of snapshot entity and the association of snapshot and VM configuration (needed for querying VM configuration by snapshot). See also [[Live_Snapshots]] <BR>
4. Direct LUN -on introduction of LUN-based disks (maybe this can postponed for later phase). <BR>
5. Hot plug/unplug - this feature may depend on hot plug/unplug - see open issues section. See also [[Features/HotPlug]] <BR><BR>

=== Clone VM from snapshot commands Class diagram and detailed description ===
In order to implement clone VM form snapshot two new commands are going to be introduced - <BR>
1. AddVmFromSnapshotCommand which will be responsible for performing business entities cloning and persistance (VmStatic, VmDevice objects, Interface objects (for NICs)). <BR><BR>
At canDoAction the command will perform the following checks: <BR>
a. Check the snapshot exists <BR>
b. Retrieve a list of all images participating in the desired snapshot chain, and check if they are available for copying  <BR>
c. Check there is no VM with the given name at the vmStatic parameter. <BR>
d. Check if the source and target storage domains exist and available. <BR><BR>

At execution phase the command will perform the following for cloning a VM from snapshot: <BR>
a. Try to lock the images participating in the desired snapshot chain (even if canDoAction passed -another command may have already locked some of them). If locking fails - the command fails. <BR>
b  Obtain a VM static object in one of the following ways (determined by a boolean flag passed in the command parameters): <BR>
b.1. The VM static object should be used - it will be stored in DB.
b.2. The given name should be used - based on the VM source ID, the VM static will be obtained by the given snapshot ID. The name field will be overridden by the value from the parameters. <BR>
c. Retrieve a list of the images from given the snapshot ID. <BR>
d. For each image of the retrieved images, run the CopyImage bll command. <BR>
e. The command will check if the status of the snapshot is partial (as a result of disk deletion), and if this is the case, a sutiable audit log message indicating that a clone from partial snapshot is starting will be issued to the audit log. <BR>
<BR><BR>TODO: Think about endCommand (as the child command creates tasks)<BR><BR>
2. CopyImageCommand will will be responsible for running the CopyImageVDSCommand in order to perform the image copying. <BR>
The command will clone the image entity , and the required parameters (such as the source and target storage domain for the given image) to CopyImageVDSCommand. <BR>
A concrete task to monitor the progress of the copy image (asynchronous operation at VDSM) will be created. <BR>
The command will retrieve using the DiskImageDAO the list of images based on the given snapshot ID in order to copy&collapse them. <BR><BR>

=== Comments and Discussion ===
Add a link to the "discussion" tab associated with your page.  This provides the ability to have ongoing comments or conversation without bogging down the main feature page

=== Open Issues ===
1. Behavior of clone of Direct-Luns based disks and of shared disks - <BR>
Automatically attaching these disks may yield to data corruption, if both source VM and destination VM are up. <BR>
If we ignore cloning these disks, the cloned VM will not have these disks. <BR>
A suggestion was raised to mark these disks as unplugged at cloned VM, allowing the administrator to decide whether to plug it or not. <BR>
