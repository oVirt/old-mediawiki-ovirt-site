== Clone VM from Snapshot ==

=== Summary ===
The feature will allow oVirt users to clone VM from a snapshot of another VM. <BR>
A clone from snapshot will create disks at destination VM that are a collapsed copy of the images at snapshot chain (the start of the chain is the first snapshot, the end of the chain is a the selected snapshot) <BR>

=== Detailed Description ===
Clone VM from Snapshot will give the ability to perform a clone of a VM , based on a snapshot of a given VM. <BR> 
oVirt-engine core will copy and collapse the images in the snapshot chain (the chain begins with the 1st snapshot, and ends with the selected snapshot). <BR><BR>
In order to provide information on the VM to be created for the UI, UI will execute a query that will retrieve the VM and its disks configuration given a snapshot ID. <BR>
The UI will use the retrieved configuration as default values for the user to be modified. <BR>

==== User Experience ====
<!-- Describe user experience related issues. For example: We need a wizard for ...., the behaviour is different in the UI because ....., etc. -->
<!-- GUI mockups should also be added here to make it more clear -->
The UI will run a query called GetVmConfigurationBySnapshotID in order to get a VM configuration for a given snapshot.
The UI should present a window holding the configuration data. The configuration data will be used as defaults for the user, and the user may alter the data.
The UI should present the disks list.
The UI should allow to select different storage domains to hold the disks created upon clone, and to select different disks types and format.

<!--GUI mockups should also be added here to make it more clear -->

Example of flow (assuming a VM was created with two disks): <BR>

The next figure shows a snapshot was made, having now two images serving as the active images: <BR>

flow2.jpg
In a similar way, more snapshots are created (Snaphost2 will be the one used for performing the clone): <BR>

The Clone from snapshot will performed: <BR><BR>

.1. A user selects snapshot2 and selects a "clone from snapshot" operation from UI. <BR>
.2. oVirt-engine core queries for VM configuration, providing the VM configuration as default values for the user to use in order to provide the new VM information. <BR>
.3. The user will override the default data values (the user will have to provide a new name. UI will suggest a new name in a format of "copy_of_OLD_NAME") <BR>
.4. The user will initiate the beginning of the clone operation.
.5. New VM entity based on the passed data will be created. Some VM related data will be cloned from the original VM (i.e NICs) 
.6. Copy & collapse all images at snaphsot2 and their ancestors will be carried out by oVirt-engine<BR>
.7. Association the copies of the disks with the VM clone will be created<BR><BR>

This can be seen in the next figure:<BR>
