''These 2 steps are currently required due to bugs, they will be changed/removed
once the patches that will fix them will be merged.''<BR>
Change the default emulated VM type by executing:
 <nowiki>
psql -U postgres engine -c "update vdc_options set option_value='pc-0.14' where option_name='EmulatedMachine' and version='3.0';"

http://yourhostname:8080/webadmin<BR>
The user is: admin<BR>
The default password (unless changed) is: letmein!<BR>

=== JBoss AS Security ===

Note that JBoss AS 5.1 does not include security fixes for issues found after it was released. These fixes are rolled into later versions of JBoss AS. By default, JBoss AS permits unauthenticated access to the JMX console. It is important that the JMX console is configured to require authentication. Failure to do so will render the system vulnerable to several known exploits, including the [http://community.jboss.org/blogs/mjc/2011/10/20/statement-regarding-security-threat-to-jboss-application-server JBoss Worm] that exploits [https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-30741 CVE-2010-0738]. Please follow [http://community.jboss.org/wiki/SecureTheJmxConsole these instructions] to secure the JMX console.
