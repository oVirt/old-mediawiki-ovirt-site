== Promiscuous Mode ==

=== Summary ===
The purpose of the feature is to allow monitoring (mirroring and redirecting) network traffic to a specific VM

* Email: <shavivi@redhat.com>

=== Current status ===
* In progress of defining the requirements from the ovirt engine
* VDSM - patch sent (mirror mode only): http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#change,956

=== Detailed Description ===
The promiscuous mode feature is about allowing a certain VM NIC to monitor the network traffic of a specific logical network, on the host the VM resides on.
There are two possible modes for this monitoring:
#Mirror - the ability to send all VMs traffic of a specific network to a single VM
#Redirect - the ability to redirect all the traffic of VMs in a network to a single VM and it will decide to forward it or to a abort, common use case is a Firewall, IDS and etc.

In first phase we will only support mirroring.

=== User work-flows ===
#Upon creating/editing a VM NIC:
#*Choose the logical network of the NIC (same as today)
#*Choose whether this NIC should be in promiscuous mode
#It is recommended that the VM containing the promiscuous NIC will be pinned to a single host (the host which we would like to monitor). One will probably want to define such a VM for each host in the cluster.

Notes:
#A VM NIC resides only on VM Networks, thus promiscuous mode is also only available for VM Networks as well.
#We shouldn't limit the VM to be pinned to host, although it is the common use-case.
#More than one VM can monitor the same logical network
#A VM can monitor more than one logical network
#It will not be supported when when hot-plugging a nic
#It will be supported only for bridged networks

=== Design Notes ===

Engine-level notes:
* Need to figure out a way to security the process of adding a promiscuous mode NIC. Today, the engine has the ability to set permissions on the VM level, but not for on the interface level.

Suggestions for the permissions support:
#Permissions on networks
#*Add the logical networks to the permissions hierarchy, currently under the data center.
#*Add a "Sniff logical network", on the network level. Each user with this role on a network will be able add a VM nic set on promiscuous mode (assuming he has edit permissions on the VM)
#*Having this permission on the DC level will mean the user can Sniff on every logical network in the DC, on every cluster (assuming he has permissions on the cluster/VM, of course)
#Permissions on DC
#*Add a "Sniff logical network", on the DC level, which means the user can Sniff every logical network in the DC, on every cluster (assuming he has permissions on the cluster/VM, of course)

Option "2" is simpler, as currently the logical networks doesn't have a main tab in the UI level, making it hard to provide an easy way to manage permissions on them.

=== UI mockups ===
Will be available soon.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
The ability to integrate the security world with the virtualization one, allowing to easily monitor and secure networks in a virtualized environment, same as done today in non-virtualized environments.

=== Comments and Discussion ===
Open issues:
#Currently, there are no permissions in the VM NIC level, allowing every VM NIC to become a promiscuous one. Such support will have to be added in order to support promiscuous mode (see design notes).
#Do we need to have a flag on the logical network level specifying whether this network can be monitored or not?
#How would we treat the promiscuous flag When importing/Exporting/Templating a VM?
