= Network features design =

== Abstract ==

Setup networks api shall enable complex network provisioning of a host i.e. add/remove/bond network with one call.<br>
Hereby we describe code POV changes for Engine as well as VDSM API implications.

=== Scope ===

# add/remove network/s
# add/remove bond/s
# attach/detach networks to/from bonds
# '''check connectivity & connectivity timeout:'''
#: after the new topology layed by VDSM, it tests if any client(i.e engine) has interacted with it  in a given period timeout.<br>  When no activity seen, it reverts to the previously backed-up topology and fail the command.
# '''force:''' VDSM will not validate parameters passed to set the network configuration.

=== Backward compatibility ===

Cluster version is 3.1.  Add record in the action_version_map table:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! action_id
! cluster_minimal_version
! storage_pool_minimal_version
|-
|158
|3.1
|3.1
|-
|}

# SetupNetworksCommandParameters.java
# SetupNetworksVdsCommandParameters.java

== Bridge-less Networks ==

=== Feature summary ===
 
All VMs today are connected through a software bridge, which naturally has a performance hit.<br>
Bridge-less NICs can serve for heavy traffic channels like migration, storage or the engine's management network.

=== Code Change ===
  
# Add bridged : boolean to network entity
# Add deserialization to bridged field in VdsBrokerObjectsBuilder.java
# DB - add field in to network and network_view
# DAO - add field to NetworkDao CRUD actions

=== Backward Compatibility ===
 
Its compatibility version is 3.1 and enforced by the enclosed command as mentioned already.
Bridge-less network will be edited via the SetupNetworks command only, which will eventually deprecate add/edit networks commands.

== Jumbo frames ==

Typically, just another parameter for a network configuration to determine the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit MTU].

=== Code Change ===
# Add MTU : String to network entity
# Add deserialization to MTU field in VdsBrokerObjectsBuilder.java. Serialise as String and not Int.
# DB - add field in to vds_interface and vds_interface_view
# DAO - add field to VdsInterfaceDao CRUD actions

=== Backward Compatibility ===

Same as for bridge-less feature.

== VDSM changes ==

'''configNetwork.py'''
<code>
 def setupNetworks(networks={}, bondings={}, **options):
</code>

The changes we need to communicate are in the "network" structure for bridge and MTU fields

'''network business entity'''

 <span style="color:red">'''note:''' </span> integer types are serialized to an xml String type on the wire - its up to the VDSM network dict to handle.

# input validation: whats the MTU max value? how do we calculate it?
