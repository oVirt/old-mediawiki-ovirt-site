=== Summary ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
The Host Power Management feature allows the oVirt engine to remotely control the host power in order to execute the fencing command as part of the high availability features, or allow the user to manually commit remote operations as PowerOff, PowerOn, and Restart.

=== Current status ===
<!--* Link to feature page in a specific release. That release may complete the feature, or parts of it. The complete scope of this feature in this release will be described in the release feature page -->

The current implementation of the Power Management is focused on supporting the most popular power management device, while the fencing proxy selection is naive, and there is no support for topologies where redundant power supply exists which requires supporting additional power management device. 
* Last updated date: Nov 2, 2012

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
When planing the power management feature for the hosts there are few orthogonal aspects to consider 

1. Supported Power Management Devices

2. Fencing logic, meaning how to determine a host requires fencing.

3. Power Management logic, meaning when and how to use the power management mechanism to automatically reduce power consumption in the data center

4. Power Management Proxy Selection 


This page is focused at the moment on item #4 and when discussion will go into the other then it will be split into relevant topics.


=== Power Management Proxy ===
oVirt uses the standard cluster fence_<device> script in order to perform power management related operations. These scripts are invoked by VDSM and controlled by the engine. The power management proxy may be any server in the system that has VDSM and fence-agents installed with the proper certificates, even if it is not a host.

Proper proxy selection depends on the networking topology of the data center and user preferences.

Current design assumes any host in the data center may be used for fencing which requires all the hosts to have rout to all the fencing devices in the system, in reality out of band management networks are usually confined within the same clusters and sometimes even to specific hosts.

This requires to add the ability to specify, per host, multiple power management devices options in priority. Per option need to specify which device to use and which proxy to use, where there may be multiple proxies with set priorities for using these proxies. 

Proxy options may be:

# '''Engine''':  The the server hosting the engine. This requires to install VDSM on this host
# '''DC''':      A host in the same data center
# '''Cluster''': A host in the same cluster
# '''IP/FQDN''': A specific host


** Examples:
*** Cluster, Engine
*** fqdn1/ip1,fqdn2/ip2
*** Cluster
*** Cluster, DC
