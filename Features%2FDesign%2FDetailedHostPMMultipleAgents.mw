= Host Power Management Multiple Agent Support =

== Summary ==
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->

Current implementation assumes that a Host that its Power Management is configured has only one fencing agent from a certain type (i.e. rsa, ilo, apc etc.)<br>
This document describes what should be done in order to support dual-power Hosts in which each power switch may have its own agent or two agents connected to the same power switch.<br>
Agents may be from same or different type<br>
We will treat current Power Management agent as Primary Agent and the added one as Secondary Agent.<br>

== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Provide the details of the feature. What is it going to include. See the sections below. -->
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->

There may be two main configurations for Primary/Secondary Agents:<br>
1) Concurrent, when Host is fenced both agents are used concurrently, for Stop command we need both to succeed and for Start command if one succeeded the Host is considered to be UP.<br>

2) Sequential, when Host is fenced either for Stop or Start commands, Primary Agent is used, if it fails (after all configured retries) then the Secondary Agent is used.<br>

== CRUD ==
Adding the following columns to vds_static:<br>

 pm_secondary_ip
 pm_secondary_options
 pm_secondary_port
 pm_secondary_password
 pm_secondary_user
 pm_secondary_type
 
Views:<br>
 vds (adding all pm_secondary* fields)
 vds_with_tags (adding all pm_secondary* fields)
 dwh_host_configuration_history_view (adding only pm_secondary_ip)
 dwh_host_configuration_full_check_view (adding only pm_secondary_ip)

Stored Procedures:<br>
 InsertVdsStatic 
 UpdateVdsStatic
 InsertVds


=== DAO ===
Adding handling of pm_secondary* fields to <br>
VdsStaticDAODbFacadeImpl<br>
VdsDAODbFacadeImpl



=== Metadata ===
Adding test data for  VdsStaticDAOTest & fixtures.xml

== Business Logic == 
Add pm_secondary* fields to VdsStatic<br>
Add pm_secondary* fields to VDS

== API ==

The REST API will be enhanced to include the new Secondary Agent definitions as follows<br>

=== Flow ===
If no Power Management is defined , the Stop/Start scenarios works without a change.
For example, the Restart scenario is:<br>

 Send a Stop command 
  Wait for status 'off' 
    (controlled by FenceStopStatusDelayBetweenRetriesInSec,FenceStopStatusRetries configuration values)
  Send a Start command
  Wait for status 'on' 
    (controlled by FenceStartStatusDelayBetweenRetriesInSec,FenceStartStatusRetries configuration values)

If a secondary agent is defined<br>

Sequential:<br>
  Send a Stop command to Primary agent
  Wait for status 'off' 
    (controlled by FenceStopStatusDelayBetweenRetriesInSec,FenceStopStatusRetries configuration values)
  If Stop failed Send a Stop command to Secondary agent and wait for status 'off'
  Send a Start command to Primary agent
  Wait for status 'on' 
    (controlled by FenceStartStatusDelayBetweenRetriesInSec,FenceStartStatusRetries configuration values)
  If Start failed Send a Start command to Secondary agent and wait for status 'on'


Concurrent:<br>

  Send a Stop command to Primary and Secondary agents
  Wait for status 'off' on both Primary and Secondary agents
    (controlled by FenceStopStatusDelayBetweenRetriesInSec,FenceStopStatusRetries configuration values)
  Send a Start command to Primary and Secondary agents
  Wait for status 'on' on either  Primary or Secondary agent
    (controlled by FenceStartStatusDelayBetweenRetriesInSec,FenceStartStatusRetries configuration values)

== User Experience ==
<!-- Describe user experience related issues. For example: We need a wizard for ...., the behaviour is different in the UI because ....., etc. -->

A new radio button will be added to the Power Management screen that enables selection of Primary/Secondary agents in order to insert agent details and test the agent.<br>
The Concurrent check box controls if the secondary agent works in the concurrent or sequential mode<br>
