= Host Power Management Multiple Agent Support =

== Summary ==
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->

Current implementation assumes that a Host that its Power Management is configured has only one fencing agent from a certain type (i.e. rsa, ilo, apc etc.)<br>
This document describes what should be done in order to support dual-power Hosts in which each power switch may have its own agent or two agents connected to the same power switch.<br>
Agents may be from same or different type<br>
We will treat current Power Management agent as Primary Agent and the added one as Secondary Agent.<br>

== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Provide the details of the feature. What is it going to include. See the sections below. -->
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->

There may be two main configurations for Primary/Secondary Agents:<br>
1) Concurrent, when Host is fenced both agents are used concurrently, for Stop command we need both to succeed and for Start command if one succeeded the Host is considered to be UP.<br>

2) Sequential, when Host is fenced either for Stop or Start commands, Primary Agent is used, if it fails (after all configured retries) then the Secondary Agent is used.<br>
