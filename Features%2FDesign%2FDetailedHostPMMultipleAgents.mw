== Summary ==
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->

Current implementation assumes that a Host that its Power Management is configured has only one fencing agent from a certain type (i.e. rsa, ilo, apc etc.)<br>
This document describes what should be done in order to support dual-power Hosts in which each power switch may have its own agent or two agents connected to the same power switch.<br>
Agents may be from same or different type<br>
We will treat current Power Management agent as Primary Agent and the added one as Secondary Agent.<br>

== Current status ==
* Target Release: 3.2
* Status: Design
* Last updated date: Nov 15 2012

== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Provide the details of the feature. What is it going to include. See the sections below. -->
<!-- New entities and changes in existing entities. -->

There may be two main configurations for Primary/Secondary Agents:<br>
1) Concurrent, when Host is fenced both agents are used concurrently, for Stop command we need both to succeed and for Start command if one succeeded the Host is considered to be UP.<br>

[[File:hostdualpower.png]]<br>

2) Sequential, when Host is fenced either for Stop or Start commands, Primary Agent is used, if it fails (after all configured retries) then the Secondary Agent is used.<br>

== CRUD ==
Adding the following columns to vds_static:<br>

 pm_secondary_ip
 pm_secondary_options
 pm_secondary_port
 pm_secondary_password
 pm_secondary_user
 pm_secondary_type
 pm_secondary_concurrent
 
Views:<br>
 vds (adding all pm_secondary* fields)
 vds_with_tags (adding all pm_secondary* fields)
 dwh_host_configuration_history_view (adding only pm_secondary_ip)
 dwh_host_configuration_full_check_view (adding only pm_secondary_ip)

Stored Procedures:<br>
 InsertVdsStatic 
 UpdateVdsStatic
 InsertVds


=== DAO ===
Adding handling of pm_secondary* fields to <br>
VdsStaticDAODbFacadeImpl<br>
VdsDAODbFacadeImpl



=== Metadata ===
Adding test data for  VdsStaticDAOTest & fixtures.xml


== Configuration ==

Change default configuration FenceStopStatusDelayBetweenRetriesInSec and FenceStartStatusDelayBetweenRetriesInSec to 10 and FenceStopStatusRetries , FenceStartStatusRetries to 18, this will insure we are responding faster to Hosts while it change status.

== Business Logic == 
Add pm_secondary* fields to VdsStatic<br>
Add pm_secondary* fields to VDS<br>

Changing FenceVdsBaseCommand::executeCommand() to handle all scenarios described in [http://wiki.ovirt.org/wiki/Features/Design/DetailedHostPMMultipleAgents#Flow Flow]

== API ==

The REST API will be enhanced to include the new Secondary Agent definitions as follows<br>

  <power_management type="rsa">
    <enabled>true</enabled>
    <address>ip or fqdn</address>
    <username>user</username>
    <password>password</password>
     <options><option value="" name="port"/><option value="false" name="secure"/></options>
  </power_management>
 <power_management type="apc" concurrent="false">
    <address>ip or fqdn</address>
    <username>user</username>
    <password>password</password>
     <options><option value="" name="port"/><option value="false" name="secure"/></options>
  </power_management>

Add custom mapping for these new power-management fields in HostMapper.java, for both REST-->Backend and Backend-->REST directions)

== Flow ==

'''No Secondary Agent'''<br>
If no Power Management is defined , the Stop/Start scenarios works without a change.
For example, the Restart scenario is:<br>

  Send a Stop command 
  Wait for status 'off' [1]    
  Send a Start command
  Wait for status 'on' [2]

If a secondary agent is defined<br>

'''Sequential''':<br>
  Send a Stop command to Primary agent
  Wait for status 'off' [1]
  If Stop failed 
     Send a Stop command to Secondary agent and wait for status 'off'
  Send a Start command to Primary agent
  Wait for status 'on' [2]
  If Start failed 
     Send a Start command to Secondary agent and wait for status 'on'


'''Concurrent''':<br>

  Send a Stop command to Primary and Secondary agents
  Wait for status 'off' on both Primary and Secondary agents[1]
  Send a Start command to Primary and Secondary agents
  Wait for status 'on' on either  Primary or Secondary agent[2]

[1] Controlled by FenceStopStatusDelayBetweenRetriesInSec,FenceStopStatusRetries configuration values<br>
[2] Controlled by FenceStartStatusDelayBetweenRetriesInSec,FenceStartStatusRetries configuration values<br>

== User Experience ==
<!-- Describe user experience related issues. For example: We need a wizard for ...., the behaviour is different in the UI because ....., etc. -->

A new radio button will be added to the Power Management screen that enables selection of Primary/Secondary agents in order to insert agent details and test the agent.<br>
The Concurrent check box controls if the secondary agent works in the concurrent or sequential mode<br>

== Installation/Upgrade ==
<!-- Describe how the feature will effect new installation or existing one. -->

Add the new pm_secondary* columns in the upgrade script.

=== User work-flows ===
<!-- Describe the high-level work-flows relevant to this feature. -->

== Dependencies / Related Features and Projects ==
<!-- What other packages (RPMs) depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  -->
=== Affected oVirt projects ===

== Documentation / External references ==
<!-- Is there upstream documentation on this feature, or notes you have written yourself?  Link to that material here so other interested developers can get involved. Links to RFEs. -->
[[Features/HostPMMultipleAgents]]

== Future Directions ==
<!-- Issues that we haven't decided how to take care of yet. These are issues that we need to resolve and change this document accordingly. -->

For 3.2 we will handle only Primary/Secondary agents<br>
We may add 3rd agent support in future to handle other scenarios<br>
