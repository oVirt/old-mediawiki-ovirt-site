== Detailed Description ==

Managing the hosted-engine engine VM is a non trivial taks and mostly manual today. if the engine Vm needs tuning,  or some addition(add a device), one must
reach all the hosted engine capable hosts and alter the local /etc/ovirt-hosted-engine/vm.conf instances. 
Although visible in the UI,  the engine-VM have most of the provisioning actions  blocked, as the VM is a external or foreign VM to the setup, as we
don't manage its Storage Domains, Disks, Data-Center and Networks.
