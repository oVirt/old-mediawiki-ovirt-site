This article will explain how to connect to a SPICE console from either the User or Admin Portal using the SPICE Remote-Viewer Client/ActiveX Plugin.

== Under the Hood ==

So what happens when you hit the "Console" button?

# ovirt-engine sets a new password and it's expiry time (by default 120 s) which compose together a ticket
# ovirt-engine looks up other connection details (more on them later) in its database
# ovirt-engine passes all the connection info to the portal
# portal sets variables on spice-xpi object
# spice-xpi launches spice client and passes variables to it via unix socket
# spice client connects directly to a host using data given to it by the portal

== Assupmtions and Prerequisities ==

* You are connecting from a Windows based Box/VM.
* You are running
