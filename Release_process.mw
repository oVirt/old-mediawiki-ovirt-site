 - EXCEPTION: First three releases will be issued in a ~3 month interval.
 - Exact dates must be set for each release.

1. A week after the n-1 release is out, a release criteria for the new release should be discussed.
  a. Release criteria will include MUST items and SHOULD items (held in wiki)
    + MUST items will DELAY the release in any case.
    + SHOULD items will include less critical flows and new features.
    + SHOULD items will be handled as "best-effort" by component owners
  b. Component owners (e.g. Node, engine-core, vdsm) must ACK the criteria suggested.
  c. Release criteria discussions shouldn't take more then 2 weeks
  d. Progress on MUST items should be review every month, during the weekly meeting

3. Discuses the new version number according to the release criteria/amount of features.
  a. Versions will be handled by each component.
  b. The general oVirt version will the engine version.

5. 60 Days before release - Feature freeze
  a. EXCEPTION: 30 days for 3 month release cycle 
  b. All component owners must create a new versioned branch
  c. "Beta" version should be supplied immediately after.
    + And on a nightly basis afterwards.
  d. Stabilization efforts should start on the new builds.
  e. Cherry-pick fixes for high priority bugs.
    + Zero/Minimal changes to user interface.
    + Inform in advance on any user interface change, and any API change.
  f. At this stage, we should start working on the release notes.

6. 30 days before release - release candidate
  a. EXCEPTION: 15 days for 3 month release cycle
  b. If no blockers (MUST violations) are found the last release candidate automatically becomes the final release.

  c. Release manager will create a wiki with list of release blockers
  d. Only release blockers should be fixed in this stage.
  e. OPTIONAL: final release requires three +1 from community members
    + This item is currently optional, I'm not sure what a +1 means (does a +1 means "I tested this release", or "This release generally looks fine for me"?)
  
7. Create a new RC if needed
  a. There must be at least one week between the last release candidate and the final release
  b. Go/No go meetings will happen once a week in this stage.
