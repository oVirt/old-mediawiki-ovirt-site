= oVirt Release Process =

== General ==
# oVirt will issue a new release every 6 months.
#* EXCEPTION: First three releases will be issued in a ~3 month interval.
#* Exact dates must be set for each release.
# A week after the n-1 release is out, a release criteria for the new release should be discussed.
#* Release criteria will include MUST items and SHOULD items (held in wiki)
#** MUST items will DELAY the release in any case.
#** SHOULD items will include less critical flows and new features.
#** SHOULD items will be handled as "best-effort" by component owners
#* Component owners (e.g. Node, engine-core, vdsm) must ACK the criteria suggested.
#* Release criteria discussions shouldn't take more then 2 weeks
#* Progress on MUST items should be review every month, during the weekly meeting
# Discuses the new version number according to the release criteria/amount of features.
#* Versions will be handled by each component.
#* The general oVirt version will the engine version.
# 60 Days before release - Feature freeze
#* EXCEPTION: 30 days for 3 month release cycle 
#* All component owners must create a new versioned branch
#* "Beta" version should be supplied immediately after.
#** And on a nightly basis afterwards.
#* Stabilization efforts should start on the new builds.
#* Cherry-pick fixes for high priority bugs.
#** Zero/Minimal changes to user interface.
#** Inform in advance on any user interface change, and any API change.
#* At this stage, we should start working on the release notes.
# 30 days before release - release candidate
#* EXCEPTION: 15 days for 3 month release cycle
#* If no blockers (MUST violations) are found the last release candidate automatically becomes the final release.
#** Rebuild without the "RC" string.
#** ANOTHER OPTION- Avoid "Beta" or "RC" strings, just use major.minor.micro, and bump the micro every time needed.
#* Release manager will create a wiki with list of release blockers
#* Only release blockers should be fixed in this stage.
#* OPTIONAL: final release requires three +1 from community members
#** This item is currently optional, I'm not sure what a +1 means (does a +1 means "I tested this release", or "This release generally looks fine for me"?)
# Create a new RC if needed
#* There must be at least one week between the last release candidate and the final release
#* Go/No go meetings will happen once a week in this stage.
#** Increase the amount of meeting according to the release manager decision.
#** Release manager will inform the community on any delay.
# Release
#* Create ANNOUNCE message few days before actual release.
#* Move all release candidate sources/binaries into the "stable" directory 
#* Encourage community members to blog / tweet about the release
