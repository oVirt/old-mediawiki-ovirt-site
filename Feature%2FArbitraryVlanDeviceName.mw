=== Introduction ===
Supporting  vlan devices with names not in standard "dev.VLANID" (e.g. eth0.10-fcoe, em1.myvlan10, vlan20, ...).

==== VDSM API ====
'vlanid'  entry will be added to vlans map on getVdsCaps command
 vlans =  {'myvlan20': {
                              'addr': '',
                              'cfg': {},
                       <b>'iface': 'eth1',</b>
                              'ipv6addrs': [],
                              'mtu': '1500',
                              'netmask': '',
                       <b>'vlanid': 20}} </b>

<b>notice:</b> The map already contained 'iface' key which represents the base interface name.

==== Engine  changes ====
===== Old behaviour =====
The engine assumed the format of the vlan device name is baseIfaceName.vlanId.
On getVdsCaps (VdsBrokerObjectsBuilder.addHostVlanDevices) the engine extracted the vlanId from the vlan device name and set it on vdsNetworkInterface.vlanId field.
If the engine needed the base interface name it extracted it over and over again from the device name.

===== New behaviour =====
On getVdsCaps (VdsBrokerObjectsBuilder.addHostVlanDevices)  the engine checks if the new key 'vlanid' exists.
If exists- sets the vdsNetworkInterface.vlanId according to its value.
Otherwise- Preserves the old behavior- extracts the vlanId from the vlan device name and set in on vdsNetworkInterface.vlanId field.
In both of the cases the  vdsNetworkInterface.baseInterface is set according to the 'iface' key in the vlan map (The 'iface' isn't a new field, but previously was unused by the engine).

==== DB changes ====
Adding new column to vds_interface-
name - 'base_interface',  type - varchar(50)

==== Affected Flows ==== 

==== User Experience ====
There are no ux visible changes.
As before the user can see the vlanDevice on Host->Network Interface sub tab.
And cannot see the devices on the Setup Networks dialog.

==== Restrictions ====
