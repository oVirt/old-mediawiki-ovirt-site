== Demo docs ==

Here are a few documents that were "ported" (''with minimal text / markup changes â€” it was basically a simple copy/paste'') from the oVirt.org website:
* [[oVirt 3.1 release notes]]
* [[DevProcess]]
* [[oVirt_Global_Workshops]]

<p class="alert alert-info"><i class="icon icon-info-sign"></i> '''Minimal change''': The only change was using DISPLAYTITLE to force a lowecase "o" in the title, like this: '''<nowiki>{{DISPLAYTITLE:oVirt 3.1 release notes}}</nowiki>'''</p>

I'd like to include some videos embedded here (installing & live migration, and an interview, maybe).
