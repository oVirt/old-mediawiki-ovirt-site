We would like to make between 5 and 10 screencasts/video demos to show oVirt features (both new and old) before the [[Second Release | oVirt 3.1 release]].

Each screencast consists of three phases: Scripting the demoing of the feature, recording the video which shows the feature, and finally adding a voiceover soundtrack to explain what is happening on the screen. Ideally, we can separate each of these stages to spread the load of production.

== Features to show ==

Priority 1 features:

* [[#Adding a new VM | Adding a new VM]] to an existing oVirt cluster
* [[#Migrating a VM | Migrating a VM]] live to a different node
* [[#Cloning | Cloning]] a virtual machine from a template or a snapshot
* [[#Storage | Adding storage to a storage domain]]
* [[#Managing images | Uploading ISOs or migrating an image using virt-v2v or virt-p2v]]

Priority 2 features (if we have time):

* [[#Gluster integration | Gluster integration]] - adding and using a GlusterFS storage cluster as a storage domain for oVirt
* [[#Log collector | Log collector]]
* [[#Back-up and restore| Backing up and restoring a VM]]

Each of these features needs a script (the prerequisites, the steps to follow to showcase the feature, and a general guideline to someone adding a voice-over), and someone to record the video - see [[recording video]] for how to do this, and finally, someone to add the soundtrack - see [[recording video#Adding a soundtrack | adding a soundtrack]] for instructions.

== Adding a new VM ==

=== Prerequisites ===

* oVirt engine
* At least two oVirt nodes
* At least one guest image available to run on the node

=== Demo steps ===

# Show the engine dashboard, with the services currently running
# Switch to the images view, and indicate the new VM we want to add (perhaps a web service like Wordpress would be good)
# Start the new service, and return to the manager view
# Connect to the running VM service (for example, for a Wordpress instance, connect to the IP address with a web client)
# Connect to the new instance via Spice to show that we can connect to it and make changes
# Conclude

Questions: How would one show the high-availability features which come "for free"?

== Migrating a VM ==

=== Prerequisites ===

* oVirt engine
* At least two oVirt nodes
* At least one running VM

=== Demo steps ===

# In Engine, indicate which node the running service is on
# Connect to the service (eg. Wordpress blog in a web browser)
# Initiate a transfer of the service to another node, showing that the service remains available during the process
# Describe the process happening behind the scenes as VDSM does its thing
# Return to Engine dashboard to show that the VM is now running on a different node

== Cloning ==

==== Cloning a Virtual Machine from a Snapshot ====

=== Prerequisites ===

* oVirt engine
* At least one VM

=== Demo steps ===

# Login to the WebAdmin.
# Connect to a predefined VM using console (SPICE/VNC).
# Change some configurations (e.g. set oVirt.org as browser's homepage).
# Install some applications (e.g. Firefox).
# Navigate to 'Snapshots' sub-tab and create a new Snapshot.
# Navigate to 'Snapshots' sub-tab -> select the snapshot -> click 'Clone'.
# Define the cloned VM properties (name, description, etc.)
# Run the cloned VM and connect via console.
# Conclude by demonstrating the cloned VM.

== Storage ==

=== Prerequisites ===

=== Demo steps ===

== Network ==

==== Setup Networks ====

=== Prerequisites ===
* oVirt engine
* A host (3.1 or more) with at least three nics

=== Demo steps ===
# Login to the WebAdmin.
# Add a Network vlan123 (vlan, vm) to the Host's Cluster
# Show the mtu
# Add a Network non_vm (not vlan, not vm) to to the Host's Cluster,
# Assign networks to cluster
# Open SetupNetworks dialog- show the nic's and network's tooltips
# Add the Networks to one of the free nics
# Create a bond between the nic we added the networks to and the free nic
# Edit the bond- change bonding-mode to mode2
# Edit vlan123- change boot-protocol to static and configure ip and subnet mask
## ip: 192.168.10.22
## subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
# Edit non_vm- change boot-protocol to dynamic
# Check save network configuration and click on ok
# Show the network interfaces table to see the changes
# Re-open the setup networks to show changes, and open the 'edit boot protocol' for each of the attached networks.

==== Hotplug Vm Nic ====

=== Prerequisites ===
* oVirt engine
* At least one VM

=== Demo steps ===
# Login to the WebAdmin.
# Run the VM
# Add a nic to the vm, check it a activated
# Show the vnics table to show the new activated nic
