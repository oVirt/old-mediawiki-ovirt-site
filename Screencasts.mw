We would like to make between 5 and 10 screencasts to show oVirt features (both new and old) before the [[Second Release | oVirt 3.1 release]].

Each screencast consists of three phases: Scripting the demoing of the feature, recording the video which shows the feature, and finally adding a voiceover soundtrack to explain what is happening on the screen. Ideally, we can separate each of these stages to spread the load of production.

== Features to show ==

Priority 1 features:

* [[#Adding a new VM | Adding a new VM]] to an existing oVirt cluster
* [[#Migrating a VM | Migrating a VM]] live to a different node
* [[#Cloning | Cloning]] a virtual machine from a template or a snapshot
* [[#Storage | Adding storage to a storage domain]]
* [[#Managing images | Uploading ISOs or migrating an image using virt-v2v or virt-p2v]]

Priority 2 features (if we have time):

* [[#Gluster integration | Gluster integration]] - adding and using a GlusterFS storage cluster as a storage domain for oVirt
* [[#Log collector | Log collector]]
* [[#Back-up and restore| Backing up and restoring a VM]]

Each of these features needs a script (the prerequisites, the steps to follow to showcase the feature, and a general guideline to someone adding a voice-over), and someone to record the video - see [[recording video]] for how to do this, and finally, someone to add the soundtrack - see [[recording video#Adding a soundtrack | adding a soundtrack]] for instructions.
