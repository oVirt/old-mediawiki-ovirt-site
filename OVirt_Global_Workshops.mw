{{DISPLAYTITLE:oVirt Global Workshops}}

oVirt workshops focus on introducing the project, the technologies inside of the sub-projects, and holding technical breakouts for learning and hacking. oVirt Workshops are a community effort and are held at both industry events and the campuses of oVirt board member companies.

The purpose of this page is to document upcoming oVirt Workshops. The community will target holding a workshop once every 2-3 months and cycling through each geographic region. This page will include schedule information, registration information, and outstanding action items for developing each workshop. 

If you are interested in setting up a workshop, please contact [[User:Lh|Leslie Hawthorn]].

== Board Meetings at Upcoming Workshops ==

Since many members of oVirt's Board will be in attendance at these workshops, it has been proposed that a Board meeting be held at each workshop or a subset of these workshops. Data gathering for scheduling these Board Meetings is taking place on the [[Workshop Board Meetings]] page. 

== Promoting oVirt Workshops ==

The goal of these workshops is to introduce users and developers to all aspects of the oVirt workshop. It would be wonderful if the community would help to spread the word about the workshops via its communications channels. If you are looking for assistance in crafting messaging or an announcement about the workshops, [[User:Jbrooks|Jason Brooks]] would be happy to assist you.

The team is also working with the [http://www.openvirtualizationalliance.org/ Open Virtualization Alliance] to promote the workshops amongst its members.

== Other Proposed Workshop Locations ==

Kyle Mestery is working to arrange a workshop on Cisco's campus, likely in the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, US area.

We are currently working to locate a place to host a workshop in the LATAM region.

== Intel Campus Workshop 2013 ==

Details for this workshop are still to be confirmed, though we have confirmed the date for it as March 20-21, 2013. The workshop will be held at [http://maps.google.com/maps?q=No.+880+Zi+Xing+Road+Zizhu+Science+Park+Minhang,+Shanghai+200241+China&hl=en&sll=23.141807,113.324834&sspn=0.077662,0.153122&t=h&hq=No.+880+Zi+Xing+Road+Zizhu+Science+Park+Minhang,+Shanghai+200241+China&radius=15000&z=13 Intel's Shanghai campus].
