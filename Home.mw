== Community is Key ==

Community is not just about software development--there are many excellent ways one can be a part of the community, from joining our helpful mailing lists to meeting us at fun events to sending us a note to tell us how you use the software!

oVirt, the first truly open and comprehensive data center virtualization management initiative, provides a venue for user and developer cooperation. The heart of the project is the open source code of oVirt, and the community is governed openly, modeled after the Apache Foundation, Eclipse, LVM, and many other well functioning Linux communities

You're encouraged to [[Community | join the oVirt community]], and help us bring open source software to virtual datacenters worldwide.

Find out how  the [[Brussels_Airport_Case_Study| Brussels Airport Company]] keeps a vital transportation and cargo center moving by managing their virtual machines with oVirt.

Faced with an opportunity to take the approximately 150 virtual machines housed on 30 Solaris machines and manage them with another virtual datacenter management tool, the Brussels Airport IT team went with oVirt running atop CentOS.
