== Community is Key ==

Community is not just about software development--there are many excellent ways one can be a part of the community, from joining our helpful mailing lists to meeting us at fun events to sending us a note to tell us how you use the software!

oVirt, the first truly open and comprehensive data center virtualization management initiative, provides a venue for user and developer cooperation. The heart of the project is the open source code of oVirt, and the community is governed openly, modeled after the Apache Foundation, Eclipse, LVM, and many other well functioning Linux communities

You're encouraged to [[Community | join the oVirt community]], and help us bring open source software to virtual datacenters worldwide.

[[IT_Novum_case_study|it-novum]] is a company that's very focused on delivering open source, so when they decided to build a product and solution set for their customers' datacenter needs, it made sense that oVirt was included.

"RHEV and oVirt are the most advanced KVM management solutions and the only ones we found that were up to par with what VMware provides. Since oVirt is closer to the development process and the community is always helpful in solving problems, we decided to go with oVirt."

To date, the work has paid off very well, with nearly 1,100 VMware virtual machines successfully migrated to oVirt.
