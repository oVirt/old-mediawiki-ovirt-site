== Community is key ==
oVirt, the first truly open and comprehensive data center virtualization management initiative, provides a venue for user and developer cooperation. The heart of the project is the open source code of oVirt, and the community is governed openly, modeled after the Apache Foundation, Eclipse, LVM, and many other well functioning Linux communities.

You're encouraged to [[Community | join the oVirt community]], and help us bring open source software to virtual datacenters worldwide.

Meet [[Alter Way case study | Alter Way]], a French hosting company who deploys oVirt in production for their clients, because ""it allowed us to scale up as well as scale out our client workloads".

The main points which swayed their decision? "A very active community, an ambitious technical roadmap with regular releases, and the involvement of companies including Red Hat, Intel, NetApp, Cisco and IBM reassured us that the project would be around for the duration."
