</div>
"If you haven’t already figured it out, I am not in CloudSpin for money, I do this so developers have somewhere to fire up their project and put it on the real Internet. This is a place to chop, cut, rebuild, and work together." 

That's the best way to sum up [[CloudSpin_Case_Study|CloudSpin]], a one-person hosting company that's taken a unique approach to hosting: users can work with CloudSpin free of charge. No fees, just a great workshop to start building software.
