== oVirt 3.3.2 released! ==

The oVirt development team is very happy to announce the general
availability of oVirt 3.3.2 as of December 19th 2013. This release
solidifies oVirt as a leading KVM management application and open
source alternative to VMware vSphere.

oVirt is available now for Fedora 19 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5

This release of oVirt includes 175 bug fixes and the first release of the
Backup and Restore API, which enables backup programs to integrate with oVirt.
This release also simplifies the Guide Me VM-creation wizard. See the release

== Community is key ==
oVirt, the first truly open and comprehensive data center virtualization management initiative, provides a venue for user and developer cooperation. The heart of the project is the open source code of oVirt, and the community is governed openly, modeled after the Apache Foundation, Eclipse, LVM, and many other well functioning Linux communities.

You're encouraged to [[Community | join the oVirt community]], and help us bring open source software to virtual datacenters worldwide.

== User Case Study ==

<div class="text-center">
[[File:Keele logo.png|alt=Keele University|link=http://www.keele.ac.uk/]]
</div>

[[Keele University case study | Keele University]] in Stafforshire has a small and dedicated IT staff handling all of the IT demands of the 10,000 students and 2,000 staff. To handle their virtualization needs, they have been using oVirt 3.2 since mid 2013.

"Choosing oVirt has saved us tens of thousands of pounds over proprietary alternatives like VMware. Open source wins the philosophical debate for us." Cost, freedom and a robust consolidated management solution for their KVM virtualization were the main reasons they adopted oVirt.

One feature they are looking forward to rolling out to their users is the oVirt user console.  "The user console looks great, because it means we can farm out some of the basic admin tasks to people who want to do things like spin up new VMs."
