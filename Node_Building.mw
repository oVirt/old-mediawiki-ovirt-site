== Build Process for oVirt Node ==

Note:  This is a draft and still very much a work in progress.

Currently, we're heavily reliant on Fedora.

=== Get the Source ===

Use git

<code>$ git clone --no-checkout git://git.fedorahosted.org/ovirt/node.git

$ cd node

$ git checkout --track origin/devel</code>

=== Setup a Build Environment ===

* Recommend minimum F15 build host
** Otherwise there are problems with systemd and building
* Create an ovirt-cache directory (defaults to ~/ovirt-cache
* Create an RPM build environment
** If not running on the version of Fedora you want to build with, create a ~/.rpmmacros file with
*** %dist .fc16
*** %fedora 16
** If you're on the right version, then no need for .rpmmacros
** Create directory structure 
*** <code>$ BASEDIR=$(rpm --eval %_topdir) #to get base rpmbuild directory
*** mkdir -p $BASEDIR/{BUILD,BUILDROOT,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}</code>
* set OVIRT_CACHE_DIR and OVIRT_LOCAL_REPO environment variables
** <code> $ export OVIRT_CACHE_DIR=~/ovirt-cache
** $ export OVIRT_LOCAL_REPO=${BASEDIR}/RPMS </code>

=== Install Dependencies ===

* You will need (at least):
** at least sudo access to livecd-creator (preferably passwordless)
** livecd-tools
** appliance-tools-minimizer
** rpm-build
** createrepo

=== Build ovirt-node packages ===

* go to base ovirt-node location
* <code> $ ./autogen.sh --with-image-minimizer
* $ make
* rm *tar.gz
* make dist
* EXTRA_RELEASE=.$USER$(date +%s)
* rpmbuild --nodeps --define "extra_release $EXTRA_RELEASE" -ta --clean *.tar.gz
</code>

=== Workarounds for RPMs not included in Fedora ===
* cd to your rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64 directory
* copy all separate rpms there
* in the RPMS directory, run <code>$ createrepo .</code>

'''IMPORTANT NOTE'''
* There are currently 2 known overrides that need to be applied
** Need to use a custom grub2 package until it gets into fedora
*** [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=746394 Bug 746394]
*** rpms are under [http://goldmann.fedorapeople.org/bz/746394 here]
** VDSM rpms are not available in Fedora yet
*** Need to pull them down for ovirt-node to use
*** [http://fsimonce.fedorapeople.org/vdsm/ RPM Location]
* Download the packages from these locations and add them to the RPMS/x86_64 directory and re-run createrepo

=== Build the image ===

* Need to install ovirt-node-tools package built above

<code>

* $ cd recipe
* $ make ovirt-node-image.iso

</code>
