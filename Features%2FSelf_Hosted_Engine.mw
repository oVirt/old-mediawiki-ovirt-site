=== Detailed Description ===
This feature will deal with two main issues:
* The deployment of an Engine as a VM into a fresh setup.
* HA for the Engine VM needs to be managed by the hosts and not the Engine.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
* This will allow us to deploy less hardware (with the Engine not requiring a separate machine) 
* We will be capable of providing HA for the Engine out of the box, instead of using a separate cluster in order to make the Engine HA. 
* The Engine services will be managed as a regular VM in terms of load balancing, placing the Engine VM where resources are best suited to run it.
* This operational mode will attract users already familiar with it from other virt platforms.


== '''Requirements''' ==
* New installation should be simple and guided. 
* A user will start with a single hypervisor host (full host OS or ovirt-node), that can access shared storage, and after the setup, will be able to access the Engine webadmin UI in order to add mode hosts, clusters, SDs etc. 
* The engine should be able to start on any of the hosts it manages, provided the host can access the Engine's virtual disk's location.
* The engine should be highly available, and be able to tolerate host, network and storage failures.
* An ability to define priorities for hosting the engine is required.
