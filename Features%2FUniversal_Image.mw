=== Summary ===

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
A number of requests to use oVirt Node in projects other than oVirt have been received.  This feature is the conversion of oVirt Node into a generic image that can be customized for use in other projects using specialized Plugins.  A separate feature for moving the logic for working with oVirt Engine into a plugin is also filed [[Features/Node_vdsm_plugin|here]]


=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
Making oVirt Node more generic and available to other projects widens the user base for the model that oVirt Node uses.  This model will then get additional testing and use outside of the oVirt Project and thus be more stable in the long term.


=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate?
