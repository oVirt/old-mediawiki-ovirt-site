Heres a ''hacky'' way to setup the tunnel for spice to be used when clicking the engine spice button on fedora based machines.

== Requirements ==

You'll need the following extra packages:

<pre>$ sudo yum install -y tsocks ssh remote-viewer</pre>
== Tunnel Configuration ==

Then you must setup the stunnel configuration like this:

<pre>$ cat /etc/tsocks.conf
server = 127.0.0.1
server_port = 8181</pre>
== Getting the Engine Certificate ==

Download the engine ssl certificate:

<pre>$ openssl s_client -connect monitoring.ovirt.org:443 \
      2&gt;/dev/null &lt;/dev/null \
  | openssl x509 &gt; engine.cert</pre>
== Replace the remote-viewer ==

Now replace the remote-viewer binary by the following custom script:

<pre>$ remote_viewer_path=&quot;$(which remote-viewer)&quot;
$ mv &quot;${remote_viewer_path}&quot;{,.orig}
$ cat &gt;&gt;&quot;$remote_viewer_path&quot; &lt;&lt;EOS
#!/bin/bash
tsocks \
    &quot;${remote_viewer_path}&quot;.orig \
    --spice-ca-file=engine.cert \
    &quot;\$@&quot;
EOS</pre>
Make sure that the certificate points to the certificate you downloaded previously.

== Starting the Tunnel ==

Once done that, you'll have to start the ssh tunnel (you can do it automatically form bashrc or similar):

<pre>$ ssh -fND 8181 youruser@foreman.ovirt.org</pre>
That will start the SSH tunnel in the background with a SOCKS proxy listening on 127.0.0.1:8181, where the tsocks connections will connect to.

== Bussines as Usual ==

So after all this hacky setup, you'll be able to connect to any vm in the phx engine using the spice link in the UI. Hopefully that will not be needed i the future once we have a better solution (vpn?).
