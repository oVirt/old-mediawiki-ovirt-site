==Objective==

The purpose of test days initiative is to accomplish the following goals:

* Get multiple engineers and stakeholders to have hands-on opportunity to learn more about Ovirt functionality and features.
* Improve the quality of oVirt.
* Introducing and validating new oVirt 3.3 features 
* While learning about the project, the stakeholders can come with their own test cases, in different categories

==What I should do==

*If you already have the hardware, verify if it meets the hardware requirement, refer information detail section below
*Update the  Participants section.  
*Go a head and  [[Download|install oVirt]]
*Accomplish the goals set in objective section ,  run the tests,  update the test matrix.
*Running into any issues - [[Community | Try to get answer ]] or  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=oVirt| open a BZ]

==Execution Plan and Guidelines==
for '''installation''' check: [http://www.ovirt.org/Testing/OvirtTestDay#Ovirt_Information_Details Ovirt_Information_Details]
deployment options:
* f18 manager (vm) + f18 hypervisors
* f18 manager (vm) + el6 hypervisors
* f18 manager AIO (nested virt - [[http://www.ovirt.org/Vdsm_Developers#Running_Node_as_guest_-_Nested_KVM Nested_KVM]])
* ovirt-live - http://wiki.ovirt.org/OVirt_Live

The following is the list of categories which we would like to focus on.  this is basically regression testing:

===General===
You need at least two physical servers to install and configure a basic yet complete oVirt environment with shared storage to exercise the following:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Scenario !! Bugs
|-
| Setup oVirt engine using either Active Directory or Local IPA, two hosts configured as hypervisors (Fedora / Ovirt-Node / other) with power management (Storage Domains - Data Domain / ISO Domain and Export Domain) ||
|-
| Setup oVirt engine  -  basic AIO flow || 
|-
| Use ISO Uploader to populate images of OS and tools ||
|-
| Basic Network Configuration ||
|-
| Create virtual machines and assign them to users ||
|-
| Migrate Virtual Machines between the hypervisors ||
|-
| Collect log file using the log collector tool ||
|-
| Upgrade from 3.1 to 3.2 including Fedora upgrade ||  
|-
|}

===Configuration===
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Scenario !! Bugs
|-
| Configure high availability for virtual machines which are running mission critical workloads, so they  will be restarted on another host if hardware failure occurs ||
|-
| Use the multi-level administration feature to assign different levels of user permissions ||
|-
| Live Migration Scenarios ||
|-
| Enable smartcard support for a VM and verify that the <smartcard mode="passthrough" type="spicevmc"/> is passed to libvirt ||
|}

===Storage===
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Scenario !! Bugs
|-
| Use the General configuration as a base configuration ||
|-
| Create different types of storage domains (NFS, ISCSI, FC, local storage) with 2 or more data domains || 
|-
| Install at least 2 VMs on each of the Data Centers ||
|-
| Move the master domain to a different domain within the Data Center ||
|-
| Export one of the installed VMs, delete it, import it to another Data Center ||
|-
| Create a template from one of the VMs and then create a new VM based on this template ||
|-
| Move the newly created VM to another data domain ||
|-
| Create several snapshots from a VM (Each time change something in the guest) ||
|-
| Create several live snapshots from a VM (Each time change something in the guest) ||
|-
| Restore a previous snapshot ||
|-
| Live migrate a disk between storage domains ||
|-
| Storage Failovers ||
|-
| Host Failovers ||
|-
| Power User Portal provides power users the ability to create and manage virtual machines from the power user portal ||
|-
| High Availability scenarios provides instructions to configure virtual machine and host high availability ||
|}

===Network===

*Base config - single NIC, bridge on top, VMs attached to NIC
*Advanced configurations:
[[File:Vlan bonding.jpg]]
make sure each of the configs can:
*survive a reboot
*test network at both host and VM level
*ping and transfer large amounts of data (2Gb size files should be enough)
*remain operational over time (1hr of uptime should be sufficient for the basic testing)

Bugs found:
*Bug 906289 - [oVirt-webadmin] [network] Non-VM networks shown as VM networks on cluster attachment dialog
*Bug 906291 - [oVirt-webadmin] [network] Non-VM networks not being detached from cluster
*Bug 906313 - [oVirt-webadmin] [setupNetworks] "No valid Operation for <network_name> and Unassigned Logical Networks panel"
*Bug 906383 - [vdsm] [setupNetworks] Error while attaching non-VM network to interface on Fedora 18
*Bug 906393 - [oVirt] [network] Audit log message for unmanaged network
*Bug 906394 - [oVirt-webadmin] [network] Loading animation in network main tab 'hosts' and 'vms' subtab is stuck on first view of the sub tab
*Bug 906405 - Bad Error Message when Removing vNic from Running VM
*Bug 906434 - Editing vnic's type and mac are blocked when the vnic was unplugged and updated to plugged
*Bug 906440 - Updating type of a plugged nic should be blocked on the ui side

===Tools===
*Basic operations on iso-uploader:
# '''engine-iso-uploader list'''
# '''engine-iso-uploader upload <iso> -i <iso-domain-name> -v -f'''

* Basic operations on log-collector:
# '''engine-log-collector list'''
# '''engine-log-collector collect'''

*Basic operation on image-uploader
'''engine-image-uploader --name=<new name here> -e <domain> upload my.ovf'''

====New to v3.1:====
*port mirroring: one can setup a VM that sniffs all IP traffic between VMs on a network on a host.
*no mac spoofing: VMs cannot emit packets with spoofed mac address (unless specifically allowed to).
*Sync network: change network MTU (or other property) on host, verify that Engine may overwrite it with Sync network
*Jumbo packets: see if can be configured and used by storage

====New to v3.2:====
*Network main tab operational: you can search hosts and VM based on their network connectivity
*Guest agent reported devices: install guest agent on a VM and see it report internal information of the vNics (internal device name, IPv4 and IPv6)
*Network Linking: allow changing network the VM is connect to while it is running

===APIs===
by default we'll be using the webadmin as our API for testing
on this section we'll try to have default deployment with the different APIs

==Ovirt Information Details==
Beta RPMs for Fedora 18 are available from http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/beta/rpm/Fedora/18. In order to use it create a <code>/etc/yum.repos.d/ovirt-engine-beta.repo</code> file with the following content:

<pre>
[ovirt-beta]
name=ovirt-beta
baseurl=http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/beta/rpm/Fedora/18/
enabled=1
skip_if_unavailable=1
gpgcheck=0
</pre>

The run <code>yum install ovirt-engine</code>.

Please refer the following documents for more information on hardware requirements, installation procedure and software download locations:
*http://ovirt.org/wiki/Installing_ovirt_from_rpm
*http://ovirt.org/wiki/Installing_ovirt-node_from_rpm

Please refer the following documents for Ovirt Installation guide, bits location and admin guide:
*http://ovirt.org/wiki/Documentation

Please refer the following document for 'virt-to-date' tool, simple tool for setting up local yum repo with all required packages and easy deployment.
*http://ovirt.org/wiki/virt-to-date

 

In case you would like to test a product with a new test case, there is a template to be used for creating test cases. Please copy this template for the test case, and update the link in this document to point to the results table below.  It is not necessary that the person who is writing the test case will also be the person executing the test case,  please  make sure the instructions are  explicit enough that anyone who may want to participate in the test day  can follow them, and execute it.
