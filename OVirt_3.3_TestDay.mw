==Objective==
* engage project users and stakeholders to a hands-on experiences with oVirt new release.
* improve the quality of oVirt.
* Introduce and validating new oVirt 3.3 features

==What I should do==

*If you already have the hardware, verify if it meets the hardware requirement, refer information detail section below
*Update the  Participants section.  
*Go a head and  [[OVirt_3.3_TestDay#Installation_notes| install ovirt ]]
*Accomplish the goals set in objective section ,  run the tests,  update the test matrix.
*Running into any issues - [[Community | Try to get answer ]] or  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=oVirt open a BZ]

==Installation notes==
* make sure you have either a fedora 19 or centos 6.4 machine installed.
* install the release pkg: 
 (f19) sudo yum localinstall http://ovirt.org/releases/ovirt-release-fedora.noarch.rpm
 (el) sudo yum localinstall http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/ovirt-release-el6-7-1.noarch.rpm
* make sure to enable the [ovirt-beta] & [ovirt-stable] repos and disable the [ovirt-nightly] repo.
* if you're using centos, make sure you have epel repo enabled as well:
 [epel]
 name=Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 6 - $basearch
 mirrorlist=https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=epel-6&arch=$basearch
 enabled=1
 gpgcheck=0
* install & run setup
 sudo yum install -y ovirt-engine
 sudo engine-setup
* for more info, checkout [[Download|install oVirt]]

===Known issues===
====host installation====
Fedora 19: If the ovirtmgmt bridge is not successfully installed during initial host-setup, manually click on the host, setup networks, and add the ovirtmgmt bridge. It is recommended to disable NetworkManager as well.

==Regression testing==

===General===
You need at least two physical servers to install and configure a basic yet complete oVirt environment with shared storage to exercise the following:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Scenario !! Bugs
|-
| Setup oVirt engine using either Active Directory or Local IPA, two hosts configured as hypervisors (Fedora / Ovirt-Node / other) with power management (Storage Domains - Data Domain / ISO Domain and Export Domain) ||
|-
| Setup oVirt engine  -  basic AIO flow || 
|-
| Use ISO Uploader to populate images of OS and tools ||
|-
| Basic Network Configuration ||
|-
| Create virtual machines and assign them to users ||
|-
| Migrate Virtual Machines between the hypervisors ||
|-
| Collect log file using the log collector tool ||
|-
| Upgrade from 3.2 to 3.3 including Fedora upgrade ||  
|-
|}

===Configuration===
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Scenario !! Bugs
|-
| Configure high availability for virtual machines which are running mission critical workloads, so they  will be restarted on another host if hardware failure occurs ||
|-
| Use the multi-level administration feature to assign different levels of user permissions ||
|-
| Live Migration Scenarios ||
|-
| Enable smartcard support for a VM and verify that the <smartcard mode="passthrough" type="spicevmc"/> is passed to libvirt ||
|}

===Storage===
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Scenario !! Bugs
|-
| Use the General configuration as a base configuration ||
|-
| Create different types of storage domains (NFS, ISCSI, FC, local storage) with 2 or more data domains || 
|-
| Install at least 2 VMs on each of the Data Centers ||
|-
| Move the master domain to a different domain within the Data Center ||
|-
| Export one of the installed VMs, delete it, import it to another Data Center ||
|-
| Create a template from one of the VMs and then create a new VM based on this template ||
|-
| Move the newly created VM to another data domain ||
|-
| Create several snapshots from a VM (Each time change something in the guest) ||
|-
| Create several live snapshots from a VM (Each time change something in the guest) ||
|-
| Restore a previous snapshot ||
|-
| Live migrate a disk between storage domains ||
|-
| Storage Failovers ||
|-
| Host Failovers ||
|-
| Power User Portal provides power users the ability to create and manage virtual machines from the power user portal ||
|-
| High Availability scenarios provides instructions to configure virtual machine and host high availability ||
|}

===Network===
* Important Note: Known Fedora 19 bug: If the ovirtmgmt bridge is not successfully installed during initial host-setup, manually click on the host, setup networks, and add the ovirtmgmt bridge.
*Base config - single NIC, bridge on top, VMs attached to NIC
*Advanced configurations:
[[File:Vlan bonding.jpg]]
make sure each of the configs can:
*survive a reboot
*test network at both host and VM level
*ping and transfer large amounts of data (2Gb size files should be enough)
*remain operational over time (1hr of uptime should be sufficient for the basic testing)

Bugs found:
*Bug 906289 - [oVirt-webadmin] [network] Non-VM networks shown as VM networks on cluster attachment dialog
*Bug 906291 - [oVirt-webadmin] [network] Non-VM networks not being detached from cluster
*Bug 906313 - [oVirt-webadmin] [setupNetworks] "No valid Operation for <network_name> and Unassigned Logical Networks panel"
*Bug 906383 - [vdsm] [setupNetworks] Error while attaching non-VM network to interface on Fedora 18
*Bug 906393 - [oVirt] [network] Audit log message for unmanaged network
*Bug 906394 - [oVirt-webadmin] [network] Loading animation in network main tab 'hosts' and 'vms' subtab is stuck on first view of the sub tab
*Bug 906405 - Bad Error Message when Removing vNic from Running VM
*Bug 906434 - Editing vnic's type and mac are blocked when the vnic was unplugged and updated to plugged
*Bug 906440 - Updating type of a plugged nic should be blocked on the ui side

===Tools===
*Basic operations on iso-uploader:
# '''engine-iso-uploader list'''
# '''engine-iso-uploader upload <iso> -i <iso-domain-name> -v -f'''

* Basic operations on log-collector:
# '''engine-log-collector list'''
# '''engine-log-collector collect'''

*Basic operation on image-uploader
'''engine-image-uploader --name=<new name here> -e <domain> upload my.ovf'''

====New to v3.1:====
*port mirroring: one can setup a VM that sniffs all IP traffic between VMs on a network on a host.
*no mac spoofing: VMs cannot emit packets with spoofed mac address (unless specifically allowed to).
*Sync network: change network MTU (or other property) on host, verify that Engine may overwrite it with Sync network
*Jumbo packets: see if can be configured and used by storage

====New to v3.2:====
*Network main tab operational: you can search hosts and VM based on their network connectivity
*Guest agent reported devices: install guest agent on a VM and see it report internal information of the vNics (internal device name, IPv4 and IPv6)
*Network Linking: allow changing network the VM is connect to while it is running

===APIs===
by default we'll be using the webadmin as our API for testing
on this section we'll try to have default deployment with the different APIs
