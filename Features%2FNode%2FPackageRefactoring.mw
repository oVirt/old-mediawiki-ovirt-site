=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
The idea is to move different functionality aspects from the core ovirt-node package to various sub-packages.  This will allow other projects using the ovirt-node model to pick and choose which features they need.  

For Example:
* some use cases do not require virtualization, so we can remove those dependencies into a sub-package.
* some use cases don't need the UI, they just come up, run a service and communicate over the network, then finish, so UI aspects could be removed
* some use cases are completely stateless, so installation is not ever needed

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
Greater adoption of oVirt Node outside of oVirt will improve the stability of the Node model.


=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->


* Affected Packages
** ovirt-node

=== Documentation / External references ===
<!-- Is there upstream documentation on this feature, or notes you have written yourself?  Link to that material here so other interested developers can get involved. Links to RFEs. -->
* Coming Soon
