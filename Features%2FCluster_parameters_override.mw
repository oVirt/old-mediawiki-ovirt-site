{{Feature|name=VM emulated machine|modules=engine|status=Design|version=3.6.0}}

== Summary ==
This feature allows to configure a specific 'emulated machine type' for each VM instead of relying solely on the  cluster default.

== Owner ==
* Name: [[User:eshachar| Eldan Shachar]]

* Email: <eshachar@redhat.com>

== Current status ==
* Status: Design
* Last updated on {{REVISIONYEAR}}-{{REVISIONMONTH}}-{{REVISIONDAY2}} by [[User:{{urlencode:{{REVISIONUSER}} | WIKI}}]] <!--This is markup for the date on which the current page was last changed, do not change-->

== Detailed Description ==
Currently, every VM inherits its machine-type value('-M' flag in QEMU) from the cluster, this value is constant and based on the cluster compatibility level.
This feature will allow to override this setting by manually configuring a machine-type value for every VM separately.
The cluster level property will still exist, every new VM will inherit its cluster setting unless specifically stated otherwise.

==Design==
The new property will be added to the VM objects (affecting templates as well) and controlled by the user via the different interfaces.
When executing a VM, the engine will use the new VM level property and will fallback to the cluster level only if the VM property was not set.

===Database===
* Add an 'emulated_machine' field to the vm_static table. the field default value will be null (use cluster property).

===Backend===
* Add property to the various VM objects.<br />
* Add property to the ovf reader\writer. <br />
* Change VDSBroker to use the VM emulated-machine property and fallback to the cluster only if the property was not set.<br />
* Add support for commands for the following actions: Add VM, Edit VM, Create Template, Edit template, Add Instance, Edit instance. The setting will take effect only at the next run of the VM.

===VDSM===
No need for changes in the VDSM.
                 
===User Interface===
Support the new setting for the following actions:  Add VM, Edit VM, Create Template, Edit template, Add Instance, Edit instance.
<br><nowiki>*</nowiki>Each host has a limited set of possible machine-types but this information is sometimes unavailable (e.g a cluster without hosts), from this reason machine-type input can't be validated by the engine.

====WEB - (User and Admin)====
* Add an 'emulated-machine' textbox in the 'System tab' for each of the specified actions. Provide a tooltip with the default cluster machine-type (if information is available).

====REST====
* Add a REST\rsdl property for these actions.
* Display the new property under the 'All-Content' header for the entities VM\Template\Instance.


== Benefit to oVirt ==
This change will allow a more flexible emulation preferences while providing a better support for backward-compatibility. A setup which consists of several machine-types currently needs a different cluster for each machine-type, this change will allow the user to choose a cluster with a high compatibility level and then customize each VM to the required machine-type. <br />
This can be useful for cases in which a higher hardware level is unsupported by the desired OS or simply unneeded and problematic.
