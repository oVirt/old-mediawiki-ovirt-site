There are a number of ways to communicate with the oVirt Community. [[Mailing lists]], [[#IRC | IRC]], and our [http://bugzilla.redhat.com bug tracker].

=== IRC ===

''Primary channel'': #ovirt on irc.oftc.net
* Meetings are held here.
* This has been the main channel since moving from Freenode.

''Secondary channel'': #ovirt on irc.freenode.net
* Some community members are in this channel to start and grow conversations with the Freenode community.
* Conversations are encouraged to move to the primary IRC channel, but not required.


=== Weekly Meetings ===
oVirt has a weekly synchronization meeting. Information can be seen on the [[Meetings]] page.
