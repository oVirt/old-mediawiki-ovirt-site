== Refresh LUN Size==
{{Feature|name=Refresh LUN Size|modules=engine/vdsm|status=Design|version=3.6.0}}

=== Summary ===
Support dynamic increase of data domain LUNs in oVirt.

=== Owner ===
* [[User:Frolland| Fred Rolland]] (<frolland@redhat.com>)
* [[User:NirSoffer|Nir Soffer]] (<nsoffer@redhat.com>)

=== Detailed Description ===
Users need the ability to increase storage space available in oVirt data domains without increasing the number of LUNs presented to it.

A storage admin resizes a LUN using some administrative tool. (This is out of our scope)
The oVirt admin will be able to perform a UI action (TBD) on specific LUNs in a storage domain.

For each LUN, the engine will send to all hosts in Data Center a  "rescan device" command.
If all hosts return the same size, the engine will  send to SPM  a "resize PV" command.
The DB will be updated with new sizes if needed.
Finally the engine will send to all other hosts in DC command a "refresh PV" command

==== User Experience ====
In the "Edit Domain" window, a new column "Additional Size" will be available.
If the LUN can be expanded , a toggle button with the additional size available will be column.
The user can choose to select the button on the LUN he wants to refresh and then click OK.
