== Refresh LUN Size==
{{Feature|name=Refresh LUN Size|modules=engine/vdsm|status=Design|version=3.6.0}}

=== Summary ===
Support dynamic increase of data domain LUNs in oVirt.

=== Owner ===
* [[User:Frolland| Fred Rolland]] (<frolland@redhat.com>)
* [[User:NirSoffer|Nir Soffer]] (<nsoffer@redhat.com>)

=== Detailed Description ===
Users need the ability to increase storage space available in oVirt data domains without increasing the number of LUNs presented to it.

A storage admin resizes a LUN using some administrative tool. (This is out of our scope)<br />
The oVirt admin will be able to perform a UI action on specific LUNs in a storage domain so that the new size will be refreshed.

For each LUN, the engine will send to all hosts in Data Center a  "refresh device" command.<br />
If all hosts return the same size, the engine will  send to SPM  a "resize PV" command.<br />
The DB will be updated with new sizes if needed.<br />
Finally the engine will send to all other hosts in DC command a "refresh PV" command

==== User Experience ====
In the "Edit Domain" window, a new column "Additional Size" will be available.
If the LUN can be expanded , a toggle button with the additional size available will appear in the column.
The user can choose to select the button on the LUN he wants to refresh and then click OK.

==== Vdsm ====
The following verbs will be added:<br />
* Refresh Device
:input  : a single LUN GUID
:output : size of LUN
:action : call multipath-resize utility and return LUN size
* Resize PV
: input :  a single LUN GUID
: output : size of LUN
: action : call pvresize and return the size of the LUN
* Refresh PV
:input  : a single LUN GUID
:output : void
:action :  refresh PV by invalidate PV cache

The following verb will be updated:<br />
* Get Device List - Additional fields will be added:
:Capacity of path in the path status section
:Size of PV

==== Engine ====
A new command will be added:
* RefreshLunSize
:input  : a list of LUN GUIDs
:output : status of operation
:action :  send to all hosts in Data Center a  "refresh device" command. If all hosts return the same size, the engine will  send to SPM  a "resize PV" command. The DB will be updated with new sizes if needed. Finally the engine will send to all other hosts in DC command a "refresh PV" command

==== REST ====
The user will able to perform LUN resize using the REST API of update Storage Domain.<br />
An additional boolean field named "refresh_size" will be added to the "logical_unit".<br />
If the user specify "refresh_size" as "true", the LUN will be resized.

                    <refresh_size>true</refresh_size>

            </volume_group>
        </storage>
 </storage_domain>

=== Open Issues ===
How to handle a host that was in maintenance  when this operation has been performed?
Should we refresh luns when the host is coming out of maintenance ?<br />
How to handle a host that was not reachable when the operation was performed ?<br />
What if the host used for getDeviceList do not see the new LUN size? Currently in Edit Domain , the "Use Host" is disabled and the user cannot choose a different one.<br />
Consider revisit Device Visibility command to check if all the hosts are aware of the same PV sizes.
