Here are the general steps for adding a new system administrator with 'sudo' access to a host.

Modify these steps for giving specific 'sudo' access, such as to backups, restarting web services, etc. when the team is ready to sub-divide admin tasks.

* Switch to the root user or use 'sudo' (preferable):
<pre>
su -					## Or do all this with sudo, preferably
</pre>
* Add the new user to the system:
<pre>
useradd foo
</pre>
* Create the user's password to activate the account; the user will not use this password to login, but they need it for 'sudo':
<pre>
passwd foo
</pre>
* Create the user's SSH config directory:
<pre>
mkdir /home/foo/.ssh
</pre>
* Either paste the 'id_rsa.pub' contents in to 'authorized_keys' ...
<pre>
vi /home/foo/.ssh/authorized_keys       ## Then paste the id_rsa.pub
   					## contents in to the
					## 'authorized_keys' file
					##
					## Or if no file exists ...
</pre>
* ... or move the 'id_rsa.pub' file in to the directory with the new name of 'authorized_keys':
<pre>
cp /tmp/foo-id_rsa.pub /home/foo/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>
* Add the user to the 'sudoers' file:
<pre>
visudo					## Add the following stanza
					## for 'foo' below the one for
					## 'root':

#* Allow root to run any commands anywhere
root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL
quaid   ALL=(ALL)       ALL
</pre>
* Change ownership of the user's SSH config directory:
<pre>
chown -R foo:foo /home/foo/.ssh
</pre>
* Change file permissions to read/write for the user only:
<pre>
chmod 600 /home/quaid/.ssh
</pre>
