= How to write patches for DWH =

== If a change to the engine views is required ==
Follow the following steps:
* Have a cloned ovirt-engine git repository
* Setup a postgreSQL "engine" DB.
* Make the necessary changes in:
   ./ovirt-engine/packaging/dbscripts/create_dwh_views.sql

== If a change to the "ovirt_engine_history" DB is required ==
Follow the following steps:
* Have a cloned ovirt-dwh git repository
* Setup a postgreSQL "ovirt_engine_history" DB.
* Create an upgrade sql file in the following folder:
    ./ovirt-dwh/packaging/dbscripts/upgrade/
: When needed, update the new column values before removing a related column.
* Test to verify the expected results 

Please not the following :
* Upgrade runs are written to "schema_version" table.
:In order to rerun an upgrade file, please remove from the "schema_version" table the corresponding line
:and change for the previous line the "current" column to TRUE.

== If a change to the history views is required ==
Follow the following steps:
* Have a cloned ovirt-engine git repository
* Setup a postgreSQL "engine" DB.
* Make the necessary changes for the latest views:
   ./ovirt-dwh/packaging/dbscripts/create_views_X_Y.sql

=== Maintain Legacy views - Make the necessary changes to former views ===
* If a column that existed in former versions was '''removed''' or its '''type was changed''',
: It is '''mandatory''' to make the change to former views so the API will not brake.
** If Removed , add the column as Null value casted to the column type
** If the type of the column changed, make sure to cast the column to the previous type.

== Update ETL process in Talend Open Studio ==
* Have the Talend open Studio installed in the project version.
* Update the Jobs with the required changes.
* Close all open jobs. 
* Build the Job from the "History ETL" job.

* Open the zip file and copy the java files from:
  ./HistoryETL/src/ovirt_engine_dwh

To the git repository :
  ./ovirt-dwh/etl_export/src/ovirt_engine_dwh

* If you changed the context - for example added a variable 
 copy the 
  ./ovirt-dwh/etl_export/ovirt_engine_dwh

To the git repository:
  ./ovirt-dwh/etl_export/ovirt_engine_dwh
