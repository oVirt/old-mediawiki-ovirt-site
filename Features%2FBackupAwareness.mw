{{Feature|name=Adding Backup Awareness to oVirt|modules=engine|status=NEW|version=3.6.0}}

== Summary ==
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->

The feature will enable to track backups done using engine-backup utility and to alert the administrator if a pre-configurable time had passed from the last successful backup.

== Owner ==
<!--This should link to your home wiki page so we know who you are-->
* Name: [[User:MyUser| Eli Mesika]]
<!-- Include you email address that you can be reached should people want to contact you about helping with your feature, status is requested, or  technical issues need to be resolved-->
* Email: emesika@redhat.com

== Current status ==
<!--* Link to feature page in a specific release. That release may complete the feature, or parts of it. The complete scope of this feature in this release will be described in the release feature page -->

Currently backups are offered only as best practice, there is no alert or event that informs the user that no backup was done or that a long time passed from the last successful backup and he should backup the application database again.
In case of an accident, this may lead to long engine downtime and lots of efforts restoring the engine DB if no backup was done or only an old backup exists

== Use Case ==
<!--* Link to feature page in a specific release. That release may complete the feature, or parts of it. The complete scope of this feature in this release will be described in the release feature page -->
In case that no backup exists or that only an old backup is available, the system will generate warning events informing the admin that the application data is at risk in case of corruption. The event will encourage the administrator to use perform a backup of the data using his own tools or using engine-backup.
The administrator can ignore this warning but it will not be deleted from the audit log until a successful backup is available or the user disables this feature on his own risk (The feature is enabled by default).

== Detailed Description ==
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->

1)Adding a new table engine_backup_log with the following columns   
  db_name varchar
  done_at datetime with time stamp 
  is_passed boolean 
  output_message text

2)Adding Entity, DAO and tests for engine_backup_log the DAO should implement only 'get' since all insertions are done via engine-backup

3)Adding two configuration variable  (available from engine-config)
  BackupCheckPeriodInHours the period on which we check for a fresh backup - default : 6, set to -1 to disable this feature 
  BackupAlertPeriodInDays the max number of days allowed without a fresh backup - default 1

4)Adding a quartz job that will awake every BackupPeriodInHours and check for the last backup available, according to that it will set/clear the appropriate warning

5) Adding events of BACKUP_STARTED and BACKUP_COMPLETED and BACKUP_FAILED  to be used by engine-backup to record backup activity

== Interface to engine-backup ==
engine-backup should call the following procedure upon start/complete/fail 
  RecordEngineBackupHistoryEvent(db_name, done_at , status,  output_message )
  db_name is the database name
  done_at is the current time
  status is -1 for failure , 0 for started and 1 for completed 
  output_message includes the error message raised in case that the operation failed

== Events Raised ==
  ENGINE_BACKUP_FAILED - backup operation failed 
  ENGINE_BACKUP_STARTED - backup operation had started 
  ENGINE_BACKUP_COMPLETED - backup operation completed

== Benefit to oVirt ==
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->

The benefit to oVirt is a clear indication in case of luck of backups and a minimal engine downtime in case of corruption

== Assumptions ==
engine-backup is used as the backup utility<br>
engine-backup should  support in engine-backup for the exclude option in pg_dump utility   (-T), the excluded table should be written in the engine-config configuration and include all task, job. commands and compensation tables<br>
engine-backup will send audit log message when starting, succeeding and failing the backup

 The engine-backup utility will keep on backup whatever it does today, this document uses DB backup but will work the same if engine-backup was used to backup files as well.
