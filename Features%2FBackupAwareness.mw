=== Current status ===

Currently backups are offered only as best practice, there is no alert or event that informs the user that no backup was done or that a long time passed from the last successful backup and he should backup the application database again.
his leads to long engine downtime and lot of efforts restoring the customer information in a case of corruption when no backup was done or only a old backup exists

=== Use Case ===
<!--* Link to feature page in a specific release. That release may complete the feature, or parts of it. The complete scope of this feature in this release will be described in the release feature page -->
In case that no backup exists or that only a old backup is available, the administrator will see a warning events that informs him that the application data is in risk in case of corruption and encourages him to use engine-backup to backup hi data.
The administrator can ignore this warning but it will not be deleted from the audit log until a successful backup is available or the user disables this feature on his own risk (The feature is enabled by default)
