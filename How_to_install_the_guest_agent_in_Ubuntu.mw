Installing the Guest Agent in a Ubuntu virtual machine is fairly simple and will provide the oVirt-engine with additional information about the VM. The process has two main steps which is adding an install source and installing the ovirt-guest-agent package. Presently the ovirt-guest-agent package for Ubuntu is not in the official repos, but is available through zhshzhou who currently maintains the package.

== Methods for Installation ==
There are three methods you can use. 
# The easiest is to use apt-get via a terminal prompt or through the Ubuntu Software Center application. This requires that the virtual machine has access to the internet or at least to a repository mirror.
# Using an .deb package. This is more complicated, but can be done in an isolated environment where the virtual machine does not have access to the internet.

=== Using Ubuntu Software Center to install the oVirt Guest Tools ===
At present the oVirt guest agent is not available in the Ubuntu repositories add requires adding another installation source.
== Adding the Installation Source ==
[[File:Ubuntu_guest_agent_install.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Ubuntu Software Center]]
# Visit https://launchpad.net/~zhshzhou/+archive/vdsm-ubuntu/+packages
## For Debian open Ovirt-Guest-Agent for the source Raring, per [https://www.mail-archive.com/users@ovirt.org/msg10171.html the mailing list]
## For Ubuntu Precise, Raring, and Sausy open Ovirt-Guest-Agent for the source Precise
### Below Package files, click ovirt-guest-agent-*.deb
### Save the file or open it with /usr/bin/software-center (default)
### When Ubuntu Software Center opens, click install

=== Using apt-get via terminal to install the oVirt Guest Tools ===
From a terminal session, type the following 
<pre>
sudo yum install ovirt-guest-agent
</pre>
Accept the prompt to install '''ovirt-guest-agent-common''' and any required dependencies.

=== Using an RPM to install the oVirt Guest Tools ===
# Using a computer or virtual machine that is connected to the internet, navigate to http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/
# Click the folder of the version of oVirt that you are using, such as 3.2
# Click the RPM folder
# Click Fedora
# Click the number that represents the version of Fedora that you are using, for example, Fedora 18
# Click on noarch
# Your path may look something like this:<pre>http://resources.ovirt.org/releases/3.2/rpm/Fedora/18/noarch/</pre>
# From the list of files, right click the one that starts with '''ovirt-guest-agent-common''' and save it to a location on your computer. 
# Copy the '''ovirt-guest-agent-common''' rpm file to the VM that requires the ovirt-guest-agent
# Install it by using the command below, and accept the prompt to install the package.<pre>yum localinstall /path/to/ovirt-guest-agent-common.rpm</pre>

== Starting the service ==
From a terminal, enter the following commands to start the oVirt Guest Agent service
<pre>sudo systemctl enable ovirt-guest-agent.service && sudo systemctl start ovirt-guest-agent.service</pre>
The above command will enable the service to always start at boot, and start the service now so you do not need to reboot the VM.

== Troubleshooting ==
The web admin interface may take some time to start displaying the memory usage and other types of information. If you find that after some time this information has not been populated, restart the VM by performing a shut down or power off, power on, and verify that the service is started by running.
<pre>sudo systemctl status ovirt-guest-agent.service</pre>
A reboot of the virtual machine did not seem to resolve the issue.
