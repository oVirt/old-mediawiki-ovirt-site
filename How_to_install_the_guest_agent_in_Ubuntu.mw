Installing the Guest Agent in a Ubuntu virtual machine is fairly simple and will provide the oVirt-engine with additional information about the VM. The process has two main steps which is adding an install source and installing the ovirt-guest-agent package. Presently the ovirt-guest-agent package for Ubuntu is not in the official repos, but is available through zhshzhou who currently maintains the package.

== Methods for Installation ==
There are three methods you can use. 
# The easiest is to use apt-get via a terminal prompt or through the Ubuntu Software Center application. This requires that the virtual machine has access to the internet or at least to a repository mirror.
# Using an .deb package. This is more complicated, but can be done in an isolated environment where the virtual machine does not have access to the internet.

=== Using Ubuntu Software Center to install the oVirt Guest Tools ===
At present the oVirt guest agent is not available in the Ubuntu repositories add requires adding another installation source.

=== Using apt-get via terminal to install the oVirt Guest Tools ===
For Ubuntu 12.04
# From a terminal session, type the following 
<pre># echo 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/evilissimo:/ubuntu:/12.04/xUbuntu_12.04/' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ovirt-guest-agent.list
# wget http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/evilissimo:/ubuntu:/12.04/xUbuntu_12.04/Release.key
# apt-key add - < Release.key  
# apt-get update
# apt-get install ovirt-guest-agent
# service ovirt-guest-agent start</pre>
The above will install ovirt-guest-agent. Accept the prompt to install '''ovirt-guest-agent''' and any required dependencies.

For Ubuntu 13.10
# From a terminal session, type the following 
<pre># echo 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/evilissimo:/ubuntu:/13.10/xUbuntu_13.10/' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ovirt-guest-agent.list
# wget http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/evilissimo:/ubuntu:/13.10/xUbuntu_13.10/Release.key
# apt-key add - < Release.key  
# apt-get update
# apt-get install ovirt-guest-agent
# service ovirt-guest-agent start</pre>
The above will install ovirt-guest-agent. Accept the prompt to install '''ovirt-guest-agent''' and any required dependencies.

For Ubuntu 14.04
# From a terminal session, type the following 
<pre># echo 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/evilissimo:/ubuntu:/14.04/xUbuntu_14.04/' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ovirt-guest-agent.list
# wget http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/evilissimo:/ubuntu:/14.04/xUbuntu_14.04//Release.key
# apt-key add - < Release.key  
# apt-get update
# apt-get install ovirt-guest-agent
# service ovirt-guest-agent start</pre>
The above will install ovirt-guest-agent. Accept the prompt to install '''ovirt-guest-agent''' and any required dependencies.

== Starting the service ==
Ubuntu automatically starts the ovirt-guest-agent service. 

== Troubleshooting ==
The web admin interface may take some time to start displaying the memory usage and other types of information. If you find that after some time this information has not been populated, restart the VM by performing a shut down or power off, power on, and verify that the service is started by running. A reboot of the virtual machine did not seem to resolve the issue.
