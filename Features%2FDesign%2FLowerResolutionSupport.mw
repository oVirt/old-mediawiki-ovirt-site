= Lower resolution support =

== Summary ==
The web admin interface and to some degree also the user portal interface are not displayed properly in lower resolutions such as 1024x768. When resolutions are lower, the tab bar and action menu wrap overlapping other UI elements. This feature solves this issue by adding a scrollable tab bar for the tabs and a cascading menu bar for the action menu.

== Tab bar wraps when the resolution is low ==
Currently in the web admin when the resolution is too low to hold all the tabs, the tabs wrap onto the next line and overlap the action bar. This is illustrated here:

In addition to this the action button bar does the same thing, as illustrated here:
