== Reporting vNIC implementation reported by Guest Agent ==

=== Summary ===
The Guest Agent reports the vNic details: 
* IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6).
* vNic internal name

The retrieved information by the Guest Agent should be reported to the ovirt-engine and to be viewed by its client<BR>
Today only the IPv4 addresses are reported to the User, kept on VM level. This feature will maintain the information on vNic level.<BR>

==== DB Changes ====



===== Upgrade DB =====
DB Upgrade should handle the following:


==== UI Changes ====
Administrator Portal:
* VM Main-Tab:
** On ip address column a single IP address (arbitrary) will be presented instead of IP addresses list
* VM Network Interface sub-tab:
** Add column 'interface name' - presents the internal name of the vNic.
** Add column 'IPv4 Address' - presents the IPv4 addresses of the vNic.
** Add column 'IPv6 Address' - presents the IPv6 addresses of the vNic.
 
User Portal:
* VM Network Interface sub-tab:
** Add column 'interface name' - presents the internal name of the vNic.
** Add column 'IPv4 Address' - presents the IPv4 addresses of the vNic.
** Add column 'IPv6 Address' - presents the IPv6 addresses of the vNic.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
The feature is an enhancement of the oVirt engine vNic management:
* It allows easily association of the managed vNic on engine side by its name with the the actual guest's vNic (instead of comparing MAC Addresses).
* It allows to identify the network to which a Virtual Machine is a connected by the reported IP.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
Affected oVirt projects:
* Engine-core
* API
