== Reporting vNIC information reported by Guest Agent ==

=== Summary ===
The Guest Agent reports the vNic details: 
* IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6).
* vNic internal name

The retrieved information by the Guest Agent should be reported to the ovirt-engine and to be viewed by its client<BR>
Today only the IPv4 addresses are reported to the User, kept on VM level. This feature will maintain the information on vNic level.<BR>

=== User Experience ===

==== API Changes ====
New attributes will be added to VM nics collection /api/vms/yyyy/nics:
* ipv4_addresses
   <ipv4_addresses>
       <ip address="1.1.1.1"/>
       <ip address="2.2.2.2"/>
   </ipv4_addresses>
* ipv6_addresses
   <ipv6_addresses>
       <ip address="2001:0db8:85a3:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7335"/>
       <ip address="2001:0db8:85a3:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7336"/>
   </ipv6_addresses>
* interface_name
   <interface_name>p1p2</interface_name>

===== Backward compatibility =====
Note that the existing IPs reported on /api/vms/yyyy are left intact, however the IPs addresses are retrieved from the VM's nics.
   <guest_info>
       <ips>
           <ip address="1.1.1.1"/>
           <ip address="2.2.2.2"/>
       </ips>
   </guest_info>

The VM IP on VM's level should be marked as deprecated.

==== UI Changes ====
Administrator Portal:
* VM Main-Tab:
** On ip address column a single IP address (arbitrary) will be presented instead of IP addresses list
* VM Network Interface sub-tab:
** Add column 'interface name' (before mac-address field) - presents the internal name of the vNic.
** Add column 'IPv4 Address' (after mac-address field) - presents the IPv4 addresses of the vNic (for multiple addresses per vnic, field includes a comma delimited list).
** Add column 'IPv6 Address' (after ipv4 addresses field) - presents the IPv6 addresses of the vNic (for multiple addresses per vnic, field includes a comma delimited list).
 
User Portal:
* VM Network Interface sub-tab:
** Add column 'interface name' (before mac-address field) - presents the internal name of the vNic.
** Add column 'IPv4 Address' (after mac-address field) - presents the IPv4 addresses of the vNic (for multiple addresses per vnic, field includes a comma delimited list).
** Add column 'IPv6 Address' (after ipv4 addresses field) - presents the IPv6 addresses of the vNic (for multiple addresses per vnic, field includes a comma delimited list).

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
The feature is an enhancement of the oVirt engine vNic management:
* It allows easily association of the managed vNic on engine side by its name with the the actual guest's vNic (instead of comparing MAC Addresses).
* It provides the information required to connect by IP to a specific network.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
Affected oVirt projects:
* Engine-core
* API
* Admin Portal
* User Portal

=== Open Issues ===
'''Suggested naming alternatives''':<BR>
* ipv4_addresses --> inet
* ipv6_addresses --> inet6
