== Adding External Tasks Support<!-- Adding External Events to Audit Log--> ==

=== Summary ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
Enable plug-in to inject tasks to the engine application using the API, change their statuses and track them from the UI.<br>
A task may have other nesting sub-tasks under it.

* Last updated date: Feb 12, 2013

=== Use Case ===
<!--* Link to feature page in a specific release. That release may complete the feature, or parts of it. The complete scope of this feature in this release will be described in the release feature page -->
The main use case is for third party vendors, to integrate with oVirt. A vendor may have a set of external tasks that he may inject to the system in any flow. 
Multiple Vendors may integrate with the system at any given time.

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
Plug-ins using the API should be enable to inject and track external tasks to oVirt and see those tasks displayed in the oVirt UI.<br>
Tasks may be nested<br>
Tasks may run concurrently<br>
Sub-Tasks of the same Task may run concurrently<br>
Tasks/Sub-Tasks should support the following statuses:
 Waiting
 Started (only for the task)
 Running
 Completed 
 Failed

Solution should support setting percentage for the Task Started state<br>
'''Task Flow'''
   Waiting -> Started (x %) |
                            -> Completed
                            |
                            -> Failed 
'''Sub Task Flow'''
  Waiting -> Running        |
                            -> Completed
                            |
                            -> Failed

''' Operations '''
 Adding a new task
 Adding a nested sub-task to an existing task
 Removing a task
 Updating a task/sub-task status

As in the Task Monitor that serves internal oVirt commands, Task should be displayed for a configurable time after competion and then vanished from the UI.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
The benefit of External Tasks injection is the ability to track tasks that are performed outside of oVirt or hybrid tasks when some of the sub-tasks are done by oVirt and some are external<br>
this feature will enable all users to track the advance of a task that is not completely executed under oVirt.

Sample use-cases:<br>
A user would like to clone a VM and cranks up our Rapid Cloning wizard. They fill in all the information and have selected a VM that is currently running. Upon clicking Ok, the information is sent to the server which starts performing a set of actions including the following 
   a. Shutdown the VM (oVirt REST)
   b. Coalesce the disk (oVirt REST)
   c. Clone the disk (External)
   d. Update metadata in domain associated with new disk (External)
   e. Create new VM based on data from original VM (oVirt REST)
   f. Attach cloned disk to VM (oVirt REST)

Each of these items would be a subtask of the overall Cloning task. At the beginning of this process, we would create the Cloning task through REST in oVirt. We could potentially include all the subtasks in the initial creation or add them as needed.<br>

As the tasks are performed, we would make REST calls to update the started/ finished status as well as the percentage complete if that's supported.
