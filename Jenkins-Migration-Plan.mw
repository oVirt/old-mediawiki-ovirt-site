The following is a migration plan for [[jenkins.ovirt.org]] to a new physical server. 

== prior testing: (before we have access to servers) ==
# prior testing phase - test on new server before starting migration
# creating puppet classes for installing the jenkins master server + configuration (plugins, permissions, etc...)
# verify testing phase (managed to install jenkis master via foreman+puppet)
# add puppet classes to manage slaves
# setup openid as authentication for server via puppet class
# test project role auth matrix, to restrict certain users to certain views/projects
# final pad with info: http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/steps_for_installing_new_jenkins_master

==  install jenkins master server via exiting foreman (LTS) ==
# contacting alterway for root access to new servers. 
# make sure to install all existing plugins from jenkins.ovirt.org 
# enable apache server redirect port 8080 
# verification stage: new server is running and accesible via ip x.x.x.x 

==  copy jenkins user ssh key to new server -> to allow connection to services ==
# test gerrit access from new server 
# test resources server (linode) access via ssh 

==  add all existing slaves to foreman ==
# adding one by one, defining new hostgroup for each operating system.


'''----- till now no affect to exiting service or downtime -----''' 

==  migration plan ==
# copy main configuration file (config.xml) 
# disable slaves so jenkins.ovirt.org will continue running. 
# add the 2nd phsical server as temp slave for testing
# copy jobs configuration (tar.gz of current jobs dir)
# copy builds (tar.gz and move it)
# copy user database (since it's a small user db, we might want to recreate them using openid)
# copy other imporant files (userContent?) 
# verify jobs 
# detach existing slaves from jenkins.ovirt.org to new server 
# change dns entry for new server to jenkins.ovirt.org and old server to jenkins-test.ovirt.org
# verify all jobs works
::* gerrit access
::* linode access
