== New oVirt website goes live ==

To better address the needs of our users and community members, the oVirt website has had a visual refresh! There is a new, simpler [[download]] page, a much improved [[documentation]] page, and new pages focused on contributors to the [[community]] and [[develop|developers]].

There are lots of other goodies to discover, including the ability to embed YouTube videos (as you can see in the [[documentation]] page), and the entire site being powered by MediaWiki, with a very nice theme based on the [http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ bootstrap] framework.
