=GlusterFS Hyperconvergence=

<blockquote>Hyperconvergence is a type of infrastructure system with a software-centric architecture that tightly integrates compute, storage, networking and virtualization resources and other technologies from scratch in a commodity hardware box supported by a single vendor<ref>http://searchvirtualstorage.techtarget.com/definition/hyper-convergence</ref>.</blockquote>

==Current status==

* Target Release: 3.6
* Status: under design and discussion.

==Background==

This feature page tracks the effort of integrating oVirt virtualization and GlusterFS storage resources in single commodity boxes that can scale horizontally.

The issues identified are:

* Brick scaling and balancing when adding storage [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1177773 Bugzilla]
** Best practices on how scalding adding new hosts
* Monitoring disks health on the hosts
** Best practices to handle a disk failure
* Brick replace and balancing when a host failed [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1177775 Bugzilla]
** Best practices to handle an entire host failure and replacement
* QEMU libfapi support [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1177776 Bugzilla]
* Separate storage network for glusterfs traffic [[Features/Select_Network_For_Gluster|Feature Page]] - [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1049994 Bugzilla]
* Host disks management and device provisioning [[Features/GlusterHostDiskManagement|Feature Page]]
* Improve UX when creating a Gluster Volume to be used as Storage Domain [[Features/GlusterFS_Storage_Domain#Usability_enhancements_in_oVirt_3.6|Feature Page]]
* Data locality [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1177790 Buzilla-1] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1177791 Bugzilla-2]
** Scheduling of disk creation: disks of the same VM on the same replica set
** Scheduling of the VM based on disk locality: start VM on the hosts of disks replica set
* ovirt-node must include vdsm-gluster and gluster-server
* Hosted-Engine deployment including the first gluster brick [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1177789 Bugzilla]
* Data-center power policies should be aware of hyperconverged nodes to avoid automatic shutdown for power saving
