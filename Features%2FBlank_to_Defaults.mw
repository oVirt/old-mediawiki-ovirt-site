= Turn Blank to Global Defaults =

== Summary ==
Until oVirt 3.5 the Blank template was not editable but still providing the default values. 
The idea here is to rename the Blank to Default, decouple it completely from a cluster and make it editable (not deletable).

== Current status ==
* Target Release: 3.6
* Status: Design discussion

== Proposal ==
* The Blank template will be renamed to Default
* The Blank template will be completely decoupled from all clusters making it possible to delete the Default DC/Cluster
* The Blank template will still not be deletable
* The Blank will support the highest cluster level's features and when creating a VM from it, only the applicable ones will be applied
* Since the Blank template will be decoupled from all the clusters and usable in any cluster there will be the following limitations:
** Nothing which is directly related to one specific cluster will be settable there (e.g. pin to one specific host)
