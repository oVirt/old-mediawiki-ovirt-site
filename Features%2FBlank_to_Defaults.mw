= Turn Blank to Global Defaults =

== Summary ==
Until oVirt 3.5 the Blank template was not editable but still providing the default values. 
The idea here is to turn the rename the Blank to Defaults, decouple it completely from a cluster and make it editable (not deletable though).

== Current status ==
* Target Release: 3.6
* Status: Design discussion

== Proposal ==
* The Blank template will be renamed to Default
* The Blank template will be completely decoupled from all clusters making it possible to delete the Default DC/Cluster
* The Blank template will still not be deletable
* Since the Blank template will be decoupled from all the clusters and usable in any cluster there will be the following limitations:
** Nothing which is directly related to one specific cluster will be settable there (e.g. pin to one specific host)
** It will support only the smallest cluster level's features (e.g. no VirtIO RNG device)
