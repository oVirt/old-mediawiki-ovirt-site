== Neutron Virtual Appliance ==

{{Feature|name=Neutron Virtual Appliance|modules=network|status=Development|version=3.5.0}}

=== Summary ===
oVirt engine has integrated the OpenStack Neutron service as a [[Features/OSN_Integration|network provider]], providing the ovirt-engine administrator to leverage the neutron services to be consumed by oVirt.<br>
However, in order to provision neutron services, one needs to manually deploy a neutron and keystone services.<br>
The Neutron Virtual Appliance designed to provide an easy and simple deployment of the neutron service.

=== Detailed Description ===
The feature designed to ease the neutron services provisioning from within ovirt by reducing the overhead of installing and configuring OpenStack.<br>
For that purpose an image was created for a rapid provisioning, where the image contains all of the relevant services installed and configured with basic configuration that allows the ovirt-engine administrator with few (or more) steps to use the neutron services from ovirt.<br>
The neutron appliance for ovirt-engine 3.5 is based on the Havana-RDO which uses [https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Packstack Packstack] for installing OpenStack.<br>

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
There are two major benefits for having this feature:
# Enhance oVirt networking capabilities by Neutron services.
# Provide 'soft landing' for ovirt users in the OpenStack field.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
The neutron virtual appliance is provided as an image which contains:
# CentOS 6.5 (based on public CentOS-6.5 image at glance.ovirt.org)
# Havana RDO
# Cloud-init 0.7.2-2

=== Documentation / External references ===
[http://openstack.redhat.com/Docs RDO documentation]

=== Testing ===
==== Create a vm based on neutron-appliance image ====
# Add new vm network named 'neutron' in the relevant data-center.
# Edit the 'neutron' vnic profile to include custom properties "mac-spoof=true".
# Import the neutron-appliance image as a template from the glance.ovirt.org repository.
# Configure the VM with 2048MB memory and 2 vnics:
## eth0 - connected to 'ovirtmgmt' (needs to communicate with the ovirt-engine and with compute nodes)
## eth1 - connected to 'neutron' vm network

==== Run the neutron server vm ====
# Run the vm with cloud-init:
## Set a root password.
## Configure a static IP address for eth0
# Connect to the vm (ssh/console)
  # . /root/keystonerc_admin
  # neutron net-list
A list of existing networks should appear.

==== Configure Neutron network provider on ovirt-engine ====
 # engine-config -s KeystoneAuthUrl=http://NEUTRON_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:35357/v2.0/
# Restart the ovirt-engine
# Add external network provider with the following properties:
# On the general left tab:
## Type: OpenStack Network
## Networking Plugin: Open vSwitch
## Provider URL: http://NEUTRON_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:9696
## User name: neutron
## Password: should be found by: 'grep CONFIG_NEUTRON_KS_PW /root/packstack-answers.txt' on the neutron server vm.
## Tenant name: services
Verify 'connectivity test' passes (by clicking the 'Test' button)
# On the Agent Configuration left tab:
## Bridge Mappings: vmnet:br-neutron
## QPID:
## Host: NEUTRON_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
## Port: 5672
## Username: guest
## Password: guest

==== Install a Host with the network provider ====
# Install host with external network provider by clicking the 'network provider' left tab
# select the newly configured network provider and set:
## bridge_mappings = vmnet:br-neutron
# Click 'OK'
# yum -y install vdsm-hook-macspoof
# Configure 'neutron' network on the host
 # ovs-vsctl add-port br-neutron neutron

==== Test neutron services ====
Specific scenarios will be added later, for now these test cases should be fine:
[[Features/OSN_Integration#Testing|Testing ovirt-neutron integration]]

=== Open Issues ===
* Should the default quotas as configured on the neutron server should be increased ?
 [root@localhost ~(keystone_admin)]# neutron quota-show

* Currently, the only supported plugin is Open vSwitch plugin. Is there any need for other plugin types ?
