== Neutron Virtual Appliance ==
{{Feature|name=Neutron Virtual Appliance|modules=network|status=Completed|version=3.5.0}}

=== Summary ===
oVirt engine has integrated the OpenStack Neutron service as a [[Features/OSN_Integration|network provider]]. The OpenStack network provider enables ovirt-engine to consume Neutron services.<br>
However, in order to provision Neutron services, one needs to manually deploy Neutron and Keystone services.<br>
The Neutron Virtual Appliance designed to provide an easy and simple deployment of those services.

Neutron virtual appliance in oVirt-engine '''demo''' can be watched [http://youtu.be/naLFSFwHI94 here].

=== Detailed Description ===
The feature designed to ease the neutron services provisioning from within ovirt by reducing the overhead of installing and configuring OpenStack.<br>
For that purpose an image was created for a rapid provisioning, where the image contains all of the relevant services installed and configured with basic configuration that allows the ovirt-engine administrator with few (or more) steps to use the neutron services from ovirt.<br>
The neutron appliance for ovirt-engine 3.5 is based on the [http://openstack.redhat.com/Quickstart IceHouse-RDO] which uses [https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Packstack Packstack] for installing OpenStack.<br> The neutron node contains the following services:
# Neutron server
# Neutron L3 Agent
# Neutron DHCP Agent
# Open vSwitch Agent
# Open vSwitch
# RabbitMQ (messaging)

==== Neutron Appliance Topology ====
The neutron appliance is a vm running on one of ovirt's nodes. It is connected to two ovirt-engine networks:
* To the 'ovirtmgmt' network for the ovirt-engine to communicate with the neutron server API.
* To a designated network named ''neutron'', which should be configured on any host designed to run vms to use external networks.
The following image demonstrates the neutron appliance topology:

=== Add OpenStack network external provider using the Neutron appliance ===
==== Create a vm based on neutron-appliance image ====
# Add new vm network (e.g. named 'neutron') in the relevant data-center.
# Edit the 'neutron' vnic profile of the 'neutron' network to include custom properties "ifacemacspoof=true"
## Instructions for adding the 'ifacemacspoof' property can be found [https://github.com/oVirt/vdsm/tree/master/vdsm_hooks/macspoof here].
## Restart the ovirt-engine service to refresh the new configuration value.
## Enabling mac-spoofing is required for the appliance specifically for dhcp agent which is connected to the networks bridge by a port (one or more dhcp agent per network). In order for packets not to be blocked  by ebtable rules (introduced by [[Features/Design/Network/NetworkFiltering|nwfilter]]), mac-spoof should be enabled.

# Import the neutron-appliance image as a template (e.g. named 'neutron-appliance') from the glance.ovirt.org repository.
# Add a new VM (i.e. named 'neutron-provider') with 4GB RAM based on 'neutron-appliance' template and with 2 vnics:
## eth0 - connected to 'ovirtmgmt' (needs to communicate with ovirt-engine and with the compute nodes/hypervisors)
## eth1 - connected to 'neutron' network
# Edit "Initial Run" left-tab ([[http://www.ovirt.org/Features/Cloud-Init_Integration integrated with cloud-init]]):
## Add new user 'admin' (this user will be created as a sudoer).
## Set the "SSH Authorized Keys" to enable accessing the vm via ssh (root login is disabled) or define a password for the 'admin' user.
## Configure a static IP address (will be referred later as NEUTRON_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS) for eth0 (which is connected to 'ovirtmgmt') and set the 'start on boot' checkbox.
### DHCP boot protocol can be used if the IP is statically configured on the DHCP server for eth0 mac address.
## Configure for eth1 'None' boot protocol and set the 'start on boot' checkbox.

==== Run the neutron server vm ====
# Install the macspoof hook on the host the vm is scheduled to be run on:
## yum -y install vdsm-hook-macspoof
# Run the neutron vm on that host (it takes cloud-init ~4 minutes since vm boot to finish)
# VM IP address should be reported to ovirt-engine (due to ovirt-guest-agent installed on the vm)
# Connect to the vm (ssh with the user complaint to the specified key) and run the following to verify OpenStack services are active:
  # sudo -i
  # . /root/keystonerc_admin
  # openstack-status

'''Note:''' It is highly recommended to replace the neutron service password configured by the appliance:
* Configure new password on keystone for ''neutron'' user:
  # . /root/keystonerc_admin
  # keystone user-password-update neutron
* Edit /etc/neutron/neutron.conf and set '''admin_password''' to the new chosen password and restart neutron service:
  # openstack-service restart neutron-server

==== Configure Neutron network provider on ovirt-engine ====
# engine-config -s KeystoneAuthUrl=http://NEUTRON_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:35357/v2.0/
# Restart the ovirt-engine
# Add external network provider with the following properties:
:* On the general left tab:
:# Type: OpenStack Network
:# Networking Plugin: Open vSwitch
:# Provider URL: http://NEUTRON_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:9696
:# User name: neutron
:# Password: should be found by: "''grep '^admin_password' /etc/neutron/neutron.conf''" on the neutron server vm.
:# Tenant name: services
Verify 'connectivity test' passes (by clicking the 'Test' button).
<br>
[[File:AddProvider.png]]
<br>
:* On the Agent Configuration left tab:
:# Bridge Mappings: vmnet:br-neutron
:# Broker Type: RabbitMQ
:# Host: NEUTRON_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
:# Port: 5672
:# Username: guest
:# Password: guest

==== Install a Host with the network provider ====
# Configure OpenStack repository on the host (for ovirt-3.5 use rdo-release-icehouse-3):
## yum install -y http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/openstack/openstack-icehouse/rdo-release-icehouse-3.noarch.rpm
# Install the host with external network provider by clicking the 'Network Provider' left tab
# Select the newly configured 'neutron' network provider and set:
## bridge_mappings = vmnet:br-neutron
# Click 'OK' to engage the installation
# After installation is successfully completed, install the no-macspoof hook:
## yum -y install vdsm-hook-macspoof
# Configure 'neutron' network on the host using the 'Setup Networks' dialog
# Run the following on the host, to connect neutron integration bridge to neutron network:
## ovs-vsctl add-port br-neutron neutron

From this point, the following use cases are supported:
# Create external networks on the neutron server from ovirt-engine
# Import networks from neutron server into ovirt-engine
# Add subnets to the external networks
# Configure security groups on the networks' profiles
# Attach vms to the external networks

'''Note: ''' It is highly recommended to install all of the hosts within the same cluster with the external network provider (or to configured the hosts manually).
If a cluster contains a mixture of hosts, both installed with the external provider and without it, there are expected failures to schedule the vm, as external networks are considered as 'non-required' networks in ovirt-engine 3.5.

=== Making your own Neutron Virtual Appliance image  ===
Steps for creating the image and sealing it are described [https://github.com/masayag/ovirt-appliance#creating-the-image here].
Once the image is created, follow the next steps:

# Import into [https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_OpenStack_Platform/2/html/Getting_Started_Guide/ch09s02.html glance]:
 glance image-create --name "neutron-appliance" --is-public true --disk-format qcow2 --file 93b372dc-022e-4c49-a0aa-988cb1876c18 --container-format bare
# Add 'glance' as external provider into ovirt
# Import "neutron-appliance" as a template
# Create a vm based on the "neutron-appliance" template with cloud-init (root password, nic as eth0)

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
There are two major benefits for having this feature:
# Enhance oVirt networking capabilities by Neutron services.
# Provide 'soft landing' for ovirt users in the OpenStack field.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
The neutron virtual appliance is provided as an image which contains:
# CentOS 7.0 (based on CentOS-7.0 ISO from http://wiki.centos.org/Download)
# IceHouse RDO

The installed hosts should have epel repository enabled.

=== Documentation / External references ===
[http://openstack.redhat.com/Docs RDO documentation]

=== Testing ===
# Create a vm based on neutron-appliance image
# Connect to the vm (ssh/console)
  # . /root/keystonerc_admin
  # neutron net-list
A list of existing networks should appear.

# Add the neutron server vm into ovirt-engine and run it.
# Add an external network provider with the vm address.
# Discover the networks of the external provider.
# Create a network 'testnet' on the provider.
# Add a subnet for that network
# Install a host with the external network provider
# Add a vm 'test1' which has a vnic connected to 'testnet'
# run vm 'test1' with cloud-init and configure its vnic for DHCP
# Verify an IP address was obtained by the vm.
