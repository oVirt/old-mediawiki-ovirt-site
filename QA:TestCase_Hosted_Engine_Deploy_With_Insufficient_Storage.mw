== Description ==
{BZ|1142098} discovered that volume creation on systems with insufficient space is not always detected

== Setup ==
You can follow https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Scsi-target-utils_Quickstart_Guide for setting up tgtd

==How to test==
# Install ovirt-hosted-engine-setup
# Run hosted-engine --deploy
# When asked about disk size use a size equal to iSCSI device capacity
# VDSM should fail volume creation with insufficient space
