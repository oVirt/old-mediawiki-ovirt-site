== Description ==
Starting with oVirt 3.5 non-storage related operations can be executed asynchronously using CommandCoordinator framework. 
This test case will check that the feature is working as expected by invoking live merge.

== Setup ==
# Create a snapshot of a VM with disk

==How to test==
# Install ovirt-engine
# Run engine-setup
# Add host, storage domain and create a VM with disk
# Create a snapshot of the VM
# Start the VM and after the VM is up delete the snapshot.

==Expected Results==
* Live Merge should run and the snapshot should be deleted
