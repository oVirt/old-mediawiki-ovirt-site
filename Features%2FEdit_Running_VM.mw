== Edit Running Vm ==

=== Summary ===

We would like to have ability to edit VM configuration, even while it is running.<br>
Today, updating running vm is not clear:<br>
Updating some fields is allowed, and makes sense (applied immediately):
* description
* comment
* HA
* ..
Updating some fields is blocked, since some of the configuration values are not applicable when the vm is running:<br>
* memory
* monitors
* usb-policy
* .. 
Updating some fields is allowed, but might be confusing, as it will be applied only on next run:
* cd-rom - does not perform live change-cd in the machine
* boot sequence - if rebooting the guest (not stop+start) the order will not change
* guaranteed memory - will only be applied on next run
* ..

=== Current Status ===

* Status: Design
* Target release: 3.5
* updated: March 3rd, 2014

=== Detailed Description ===

This feature will allow updating vm configuration on any vm status except 'Locked'.<br>
* Changes that doesn't affect the run of the vm, will be editable as today (for example: name, description, comment..)
* If change is not immediately applicable (memory, boot sequence), a warning will be displayed to the user (UI only),
notifying him changes will be applied only on next run.<br>
* If change affect running vm, and require special operation (like hot-plug cpu),
the user could select if to apply immediately or only on the next run.
<br><br>
All vm configuration, as it is returned to the user today (using search and queries,<br>
-> what is shown in the vm main tab) will always be the current configuration.<br>
If there is a different configuration for the next run for a vm, an icon will appear next to the VM in the grid<br>
the detailed configuration would appear in the 'edit vm' dialog.<br>

=== Implementation ===

''' Backend '''<br>
if vm is edited, and is not in down state, all changes that can be applied immediately will be saved to the vm_static table (and to 'running' snapshot if exists).<br>
if there are other changes, create/update a special 'running' snapshot with all information.<br>
when vm goes down, if 'running' snapshot exists, apply the configuration to the vm_static table.<br>
<br>
''' DB '''<br>
Add to VM object and view an indicator if a 'running' snapshot exists, for UI and REST use.<br>
<br>
''' UI '''<br>
On Edit Vm, if 'running' snapshot exists, load it to the edit dialog.<br>
Show warning to the user if anything changed that require restart.<br>
Allow the user to choose if to apply now changes that can be applied.<br>
<br>[[File:Edit_running_vm.png]]<br>
<br>
On VM main grid, add an icon notifying there is a running configuration for each vm with this field true.<br>
<br>
''' REST API '''<br>
Add corresponding element for vm to notify for each vm if there is a running configuration for it.<br>
Add a URL-parameter to get and put vm, in order to be able to get the 'running' configuration for a VM,<br>
and also in update vm, to allow the user to decide if to apply changes now for applicable changes.<br>

=== Open Issues ===
* what about changing cd rom ? will it do live change cd, or like today?
