{{Feature|name=IP address configuration on role bearing NICs|modules=Networking|version=oVirt 3.6|status=design|}}
<!-- {{autolang|base=yes}} -->

= Summary =
Currently it is possible to configure a role network (migration/display/gluster) on a NIC without specifying IP address configuration on it. 
* In case of migration with misconfigured migration network the migration would be performed on management network.
* Misconfigured display network would make impossible connecting to VMs console.
The RFC is about to prevent such situations.

= Motivation = 
Make network roles actually do what they were designed for.

= Proposed solution =
The proposed solution is two-phased:

# Preventing any '''new''' problematic network configuration - to be implemented in v3.6
## Host setup network will block configuring a role bearing network without setting an IP (static/DHCP). That means any network configuration operation on the host will be blocked if a role bearing network on that host is configured improperly.
## Assigning a role to a network will be blocked if one of the cluster hosts that already has the network don't have an IP protocol configured on it.
## An event will be added to warn user of networks with non-VM roles that do not have IP. This should be added to event flood protection  to make sure audit log is not badly affected.
# Enforcing the proper configuration on active hosts - to be implemented in a further version (supposedly 4.0).  Failing validation will make a host non-operational and/or prevents it to be such. That will affect all flows that involve getCapabilities being run on a host, e.g.:
## Any time the engine is restarted (e.g. engine upgrade).
## User initiated refresh capabilities.
## Activating a host.

In the second phase we might prevent the upgrade and/or worn user about a situation when active hosts will become non-operational after the upgrade.
