=Decommission Master Domain and SPM=
 
== Summary ==
By introducing advanced flows (live snapshots, live storage migration, live merge) engine orchestration and VDSM commands implementation grew in complexity because of the SPM-HSM roles differences. In addition the concept of Storage Pool (initially introduced to simplify cross-domain operations) became an obstacle in managing and scaling storage domains.

The goal of this feature is to remove the SPM role and the Storage Pool concept from the oVirt storage subsystem. As a consequence the Master Domain and its special content will disappear as well (pool metadata, asynchronous tasks persistency and ovf backups) simplifing the implementation and getting rid of several known problems. A set of [[Features/Decommission_Master_Domain_and_SPM#New_Storage_API|New Storage API]] will be introduced to address the new architecture (no task persistency and short-lived sanlock metadata lock).

More information:

* Remove Master Domain and File-System: stop designating a master domain and maintaining a file-system for asynchronous tasks peristency and ovf backups
** [[Features/StoragePool_Metadata_Removal|Decommission Storage Pool Metadata]]
** [[Feature/OvfOnWantedDomains|Store OVF on Regular Volumes]]
** Drop task persistency with the [[Features/Decommission_Master_Domain_and_SPM#New_Storage_API|New Storage API]]
* Remove SPM: the SPM role is replaced with a short-lived domain metadata lock on the relevant storage domain(s)
** [[Features/Decommission_Master_Domain_and_SPM#New_Storage_API|New Storage API]]

== Background ==

==Connect Storage Pool==

 connectStoragePool(spUUID, hostID, msdUUID, masterVersion, domainsMap)

For backward compatibility with running VMs we must maintain the volume links in /rhev/data-center (and also to support live migration without any additional change). The only purpose to keep this API is to communicate the list of domains to monitor and the spUUID used to maintain the symlinks (/rhev/data-center/spUUID).

VDSM will allow a connectStoragePool request using a blank msdUUID:

 msdUUID = 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
 masterVersion = 0

In this case:

* connectStoragePool with blank msdUUID will fail if the host is the SPM (incompatible with this request)
* in this state the host will refuse to become an SPM
* the mailbox won't be active (sending/receiving)
* all the major flows involving the master domain will be prevented (masterMigrate, reconstructMaster, etc.)
* the refresh flow will still be valid and the links will be maintained (except for the masterd symlink)

This API may be removed in the future but at the moment it's not strictly related to (nor required by) the Master Domain and SPM removal. In order to allow incremental achievable changes connectStoragePool will be addressed in the future with a solution that also covers running VMs.

==New Task Infrastructure and the taskUUID Argument==

The old SPM verbs are tightly coupled with the Asynchronous Tasks persisted on the master domain. In fact all the volume operations (creation, deletion, etc.) are updating their status in the master domain in order to rollback when interrupted.
The new tasks infrastructure won't provide any persistency for the ongoing Asynchronous Tasks, therefore the new storage API should be designed in such a way that all operations when interrupted should leave garbage that is easy to identify and clean up.

Relevant RFE:

* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1080379
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1080384

In the future when JSON-RPC will be introduced all the incoming requests from the engine will automatically have an UUID that can be used to identify asynchronous operations.

==New Storage API==

Goals of the new storage API are:

* '''Splitting Metadata and Data Operations''' (allowing to decouple short metadata changes and long data operations)
* '''Replace SPM with a Short-Lived Domain Metadata Lock''' (non-atomic metadata changes will require a domain metadata lock)
* '''Consolidate API''' (API should be minimal and allow composition for complex flows)
* '''No Task Peristency''' (storage operations must drop the old tasks persistency)
* '''Garbage Collection''' (leftovers of partial operations should be easy to identify and collect)

The old API commands that should be re-implemented are:

===Create Volume===

 createVolumeContainer(sdUUID, imgUUID, size, volFormat, diskType, volUUID, desc, srcImgUUID, srcVolUUID)

'''Parameters:'''
* '''sdUUID''', '''imgUUID''', '''volUUID''': domain, image and volume uuids
* '''size''': The intended capacity of the new volume (in sectors)
* '''volFormat''': Request either cow (4) or raw (5)
* '''diskType''': (Legacy) Set the type of disk to be created: unknown (0), system (1), data (2), shared (3), swap (4), temporary (5)
* '''desc''': Set a volume description
* '''srcImgUUID''', '''srcVolUUID''': parent image and volume uuids

This (synchronous) API will allow to create a volume in a storage domain. The operation mostly involves metadata changes and it should leave the volume fully prepared and ready to be used or in an inconsistent way easily identifiable from the garbage collector.

Overview of the flow on block domains:

* create a new volume (marked as not-ready)
* allocate the new volume metadata and lease area
* initialize the qcow2 format (when needed)
* mark the parent as internal volume
* mark the volume as ready

Overview of the flow on file domains:

* prepare a new image directory (when needed)
* hard-link the template volume, metadata and lease files (when needed)
* create a new volume (marked as not-ready)
* create the new volume metadata and lease files
* initialize the qcow2 format (when needed)
* mark the parent as internal volume
* mark the volume as ready

'''Completion check''': on success getVolumeInfo will return the new volume info (on failure VolumeDoesNotExist will be raised)

Garbage collection (for unfinished volumes):

* for files use two simple garbage collectors
* volumes that are marked as not-ready will be removed
* unmark the parent as internal volume (when needed)

===Delete Volumes===

 removeVolumes(sdUUID, imgUUID, volumeList)

'''Parameters:'''
* '''sdUUID''', '''imgUUID''', '''volumeList''': domain UUID, image UUID, and volume UUID list

This (synchronous) API will allow to delete one or more volumes from an image.  The volume list must be in ascendant order (beginning with the leaf and including additional consecutive volumes as desired).  

Overview of the flow on file and block domains:

* Rename the volume using a special removing postfix
* Invoke the garbage collector which will:
** mark the parent as leaf volume or update the chain (e.g. live merge case)
** remove the volume metadata and lease files
** remove the volume

'''Completion check''': on success getVolumeInfo will raise VolumeDoesNotExist (on failure the volume info are returned)

<div class="alert alert-info">
It looks possible to also remove an entire image in one shot (e.g. on block domains use the image tag to remove all the volumes, on file domains rename the image directory as not-ready). At the moment this is out of scope of the changes and it can be introduced later when volUUID is blank.
</div>

===Allocate Volume===

 allocateVolume(sdUUID, imgUUID, volUUID, wipeData)

'''Parameters:'''
* '''sdUUID''', '''imgUUID''', '''volUUID''': domain, image and volume uuids
* '''wipeData''': whether to allocate the volume wiping the data (faster) or maintaining it (slower)

This call is used to preallocate the volume area (relevant only for file domains and raw volumes).
In conjunction with createVolumeV2 this API can be used to implement the old behavior of createVolume with preallocated=True.

In the future it may be implemented using fallocate(2):

<blockquote>
fallocate() allows the caller to directly manipulate the allocated disk space for the file referred to by fd for the byte range starting at offset and continuing for len bytes.
After a successful call, subsequent writes into this range are guaranteed not to fail because of lack of disk space.
</blockquote>

Since fallocate is currently not supported on NFS (it may be introduced in v4.2) the implementation will rely on the old behavior of writing zeroes to the volume.

Overview of the flow on file domains:

* allocate the volume
* mark the volume as preallocated (for backward compatibility)

'''Completion check''': getVolumeInfo will report the volume as preallocated

<div class="alert alert-info">
It seems that to preserve the fallocate/allocateVolume semantic we should not simply write zeroes, but actually preallocate the volume space maintaining all the previous data (read/write). This behavior may be slow for new created volumes that we want just to preallocate with zeroes. For this reason I suggest to add a '''wipeData''' flag in the API that eventually can be used to specify to delete the data in the volume.
</div>

===Wipe Volume===

 wipeVolume(sdUUID, imgUUID, volUUID)

'''Parameters:'''
* '''sdUUID''', '''imgUUID''', '''volUUID''': domain, image and volume uuids

Wipe volume is used to remove the data stored in the volume (mostly for security reasons, relevant for block domains).

In conjunction with deleteVolumeV2 this API can be used to implement the old behavior of deleteVolume with postZero=True.

Eventually a set of different wiping algorithms can be supported similarly to [http://libvirt.org/html/libvirt-libvirt.html#virStorageVolWipeAlgorithm virStorageVolWipeAlgorithm]

Overview of the flow on block domains (file domains are not relevant):

* mark volume as illegal
* wipe the content of the volume
* rebuild the qcow2 header (when needed)
* mark volume as legal

'''Completion check''': getVolumeInfo will report the volume as legal

<div class="alert alert-info">
Provided some assumptions and flags this API may be unified with allocateVolume. At the moment given the two different semantics it makes sense to keep them separated.
</div>

===Copy Volume===

 copyVolumeData(srcImage, dstImage, collapsed)

'''Parameters:'''
* '''srcImage''', '''dstImage''': source and destination items to copy (luns, vdsm images, remote images)
* '''collapsed''': whether the source volume chain should be collapsed or not

This API will allow copy between different image repositories. The parameters srcImage and dstImage describe

 lunItem = {
   'type': 'lun',
   'guid': <lun_guid>,
 }

 vdsmImageItem = {
   'type': 'image',
   'sduuid': <storage_domain_uuid>,
   'imguuid': <image_uuid>,
   'voluuid': <volume_uuid>,
 }

 httpImageItem = {
   'type': 'http',
   'url': <image_url>,
   'headers': <http_headers>,
 }

This API will cover the old copyImage, moveImage, downloadImage, uploadImage and cloneImageStructure/syncImageData.

Overview of the flow on file and block domains:

* mark the volume as illegal
* copy the data from source to destination
* mark the volume as legal

'''Completion check''': getVolumeInfo will report the volume as legal and unlocked

<div class="alert alert-info">
At the moment this API assumes that the destination container should be already prepared (e.g. destination volume was created). This behavior allows cloneImageStructure to be reimplemented with a series of createVolumeContainer and syncImageData with a series of (eventually concurrent) copyVolumeData requests.
</div>

===Extend Volume Size===

 extendVolumeSize(sdUUID, imgUUID, volUUID, size)

'''Parameters:'''
* '''sdUUID''', '''imgUUID''', '''volUUID''': domain, image and volume uuids
* '''size''': new volume size in bytes

===Merge Snapshots===

'''Parameters:'''
 mergeSnapshotsV2(sdUUID, imgUUID, ancVolUUID, sucVolUUID, postZero)

* '''sdUUID''', '''imgUUID''': domain and image uuids
* '''ancVolUUID'''', '''sucVolUUID''': ancestor and successur volumes uuids
