=== Where do I define my db connection? ===
in JBoss 7.x the database configuration is defined in $BOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
              <datasources>
                <datasource jndi-name="java:/ENGINEDataSource" pool-name="ENGINEDataSource" enabled="true">
                    <connection-url>jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ovirt</connection-url>
                    <driver>postgresql</driver>
                    <transaction-isolation>TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED</transaction-isolation>
                    <pool>
                        <min-pool-size>1</min-pool-size>
                        <max-pool-size>100</max-pool-size>
                        <prefill>true</prefill>
                    </pool>
                    <security>
                        <user-name>postgres</user-name>
                    </security>
                    <statement>
                        <prepared-statement-cache-size>100</prepared-statement-cache-size>
                    </statement>
                </datasource>
                <drivers>
                    <driver name="postgresql" module="org.postgresql">
                        <xa-datasource-class>org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource</xa-datasource-class>
                    </driver>
                </drivers>
            </datasources>

== Database objects ==

All database objects are defined under the ''dbscripts'' directory

=== Tables ===
All table definitions are defined in ''create_tables.sql'' script<br>
This includes only the baseline of the database while each addition to this structure is done via an upgrade script.

=== Constrains ===
The ''create_tables.sql'' script includes also constrains definitions of 3 types
  Foreign keys
  Default value for a column
  Value validation

=== Indexes ===
Generally, ''postgres'' implies an index on the table PK<br>
Apart of that this file has also some secondary index definitions to boost related queries<br>
Since our application is mostly for ''read'' operations, adding an index does not affect the application performance<br>

=== Views ===
All table definitions are defined in ''create_views.sql'' script<br>
Any modification to a view is done directly on this file.<br>

=== Stored Procedures ===
All application store procedure definitions are defined in files that match the *_sp.sql pattern<br>
Any modification to a those files is done directly in the relevant file.<br>

=== Helper functions ===
Helper functions are defined in ''common_sp.sql'' script and have the ''fn_db_'' prefix<br>
Those functions are mostly used in upgrade scripts (explained later on)

== Scripts ==
All scripts resides under the ''dbscripts'' directory<br>
