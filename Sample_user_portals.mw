Samples Portals repository is hosted in gerrit:
* http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=samples-portals.git;a=tree;f=java
* http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=samples-portals.git;a=tree;f=python
* http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=samples-portals.git;a=tree;f=ruby
and contain examples on using the oVirt SDK in order to develop a basic User Portal.
The basic idea is to show how simple it is to use the oVirt SDK to support the following operations:
* Login
* Logout
* Start VM
* Stop VM
* Connect to VM console
* Get VM status
* Show VM display type (SPICE/VNC)

The portals are using the user-level API.

Currently we created examples in three different languages, Java, Python and Ruby.

* The Java portal is using the oVirt Java SDK: 
http://www.ovirt.org/Java-sdk

* The Python portal is using the oVirt Python SDK:
http://www.ovirt.org/Python-sdk

* Ruby currently don't have oVirt SDK, so in the Ruby portal we are using rbovirt, which contains partial REST bundings to basic operations. You can find it in:
https://github.com/abenari/rbovirt

The Portals enable user to connect to VM via SPICE under Firefox or Internet Explorer.
In order to start a SPICE session we need to set a ticket for the VM (SDK call),
the ticket is the spice password,
We also need the host IP and port which provided via the display entity (a property of VM).
