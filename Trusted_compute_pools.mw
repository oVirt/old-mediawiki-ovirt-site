* Still in design phase
* Last updated date: Nov 20, 2012


=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
The feature will allow data center administrator to build trusted computing pools based on H/W-based security features, such as Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT). Combining attestation done by a separate entity (i.e. "remote attestation"), the administrator can ensure that verified measurement of software be running in hosts, thus they can establish the foundation for the secure enterprise stack. Such remote attestation services can be developed by using SDK provided by OpenAttestation project.

Remote Attestation server performs host verification through following steps:

1. Hosts boot with Intel TXT technology enabled

2. The hosts' BIOS, hypervisor and OS are measured

3. These measured data is sent to Attestation server when challenged by attestation server

4. Attestation server verifies those measurements against good/known database to determine hosts' trustworthiness

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
This is a new feature, it will bring higher security level for data center managed with oVirt.
