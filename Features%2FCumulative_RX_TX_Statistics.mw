{{Feature|name=Cumulative RX/TX Interface Statistics|modules=engine,vdsm|status=Design|version=3.6.0}}

== Summary ==
This feature will implement reporting of total received/transmitted bytes per network interface (both for hosts and for VMs), on top of the currently-reported receive/transmit rate.

== Owner ==
* Name: Lior Vernia
* Email: lvernia@redhat.com


== Benefit to oVirt ==
Numerous benefits have been suggested:
* This data is useful in VDI use cases, where total VM network usage needs to be accounted for.  While it's possible to compute total usage out of the reported rates, it requires implementing some logic in a script, and the precision of the reported rate is limited).
* Due to the aforementioned limited precision of reported rate (e.g. traffic needs to be bigger, on average over a 15-second period, than an interface's speed divided by 1000 to be reported), reporting the total RX/TX statistics will allow to spot thinner traffic going through the interface, for example to make sure that an interface is operational.


== Detailed Description ==
Currently, the only network usage statistics reported for network interfaces (whether host or VM) are momentary receive/transmit rates. By popular demand, as part of this feature reporting will be added for total received/transmitted bytes for both hosts and VMs, both in the GUI and via REST.

This will generally be implemented by having vdsm report total RX/TX byte statistics and sample times back to the engine, and having the engine store and show those statistics, as well as compute the average rate from the previous sample rather than depend on the reported vdsm rate (depending on cluster compatibility version).

== Testing ==

=== Host interfaces ===
* Verify the reported RX/TX values correspond to the ones reported inside the host itself, when running for example "ip -s link show" on the interface.
* Initiate constant traffic on a host interface (for example by using iperf), of a rate lower than the interface's speed divided by 1000. Verify that while no rate is displayed, the total byte count increases as expected.

=== VM interfaces ===
* Verify that when a new VM is created, total RX/TX statistics show zero.
* Run the same tests as with host interfaces.
* Migrate the VM - make sure that after the VM finishes migrating, total RX/TX statistics don't reset to zero.

== Contingency Plan ==

Could be postponed to the next minor version - this feature doesn't provide critical functionality, and workarounds exist.

== Comments and Discussion ==

At the moment there don't appear to be any open issues concerning this feature. The feature is being discussed in a dedicated thread on the users@ovirt.org mailing list.
