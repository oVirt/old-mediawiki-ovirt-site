oVirt Engine and oVirt Node Integration (based on Fedora).

This is a work in progress for making oVirt engine and oVirt node/regular host run on Fedora

== Host Machine ==

=== oVirt Node ===

# Fix bridge name
#* See: http://gerrit.ovirt.org/311
# Fix Registration URI
#* See: http://gerrit.ovirt.org/318
#* See: http://gerrit.ovirt.org/310
# Fix public key file name
#* See: http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#change,311

=== Fedora / other RPM and yum based host ===
- the process started on Fedora 14 machine which was updated by yum to Fedora 16
* clone the latest vdsm fro gerrit.ovirt.org/vdsm
 git clone git://gerrit.ovirt.org/vdsm
 cd vdsm
* all the patches on the ovirt node needs to be applied here as well (soon will be merged)
* rpm it
 
 ./autogen.sh --system && ./configure
 make clean && make rpm
 cd /root/rpmbuild/RPM/noarch
 yum localinstall *.rpm

rpm deps:
* autogen
* rpm-build
* redhat-rpm-config

== Engine core machine ==

* The engine core was built on fedora 14 but all stages applies for later versions and other distro's as well.
* The engine was built from sources and installed via maven on a pre-installed jboss 5.1.0-GA server.
* Follow these steps(link the installation process from the wiki).

Create /etc/pki/engine/ca
 mkdir -p /etc/pki/engine/ca
Creating OpenSSH convertor: compile pubkey2ssh
 cd backend/manager/3rdparty/pub2ssh/src
 gcc -o pubkey2ssh pubkey2ssh.c -lcrypto
 cp pubkey2ssh /etc/pki/engine/ca/
Create relevant Engine folders
 sudo mkdir -p /var/lock/engine /usr/share/engine/backend/manager/conf/
Put vds_installer.py in place
 cp backend/manager/conf/vds_installer.py
Create CA and certs
 cd backend/manager/conf/ca
 ./installCA_dev.sh `pwd` /etc/pki/engine
Copy cert to Jboss root dir
 cp /etc/pki/engine/ca/keys/engine.ssh.key.txt /usr/local/jboss/server/default/deploy/ROOT.war/
DB updates:
 psql engine postgres -c "update vdc_options set option_value = '/etc/pki/engine/ca/certs/engine.cer' where option_name = 'CertificateFileName';"
 psql engine postgres -c "update vdc_options set option_value = '/etc/pki/engine/ca/.keystore' where option_name = 'TruststoreUrl';"
 psql engine postgres -c "update vdc_options set option_value = '/etc/pki/engine/ca/' where option_name = 'CABaseDirectory';"
 psql engine postgres -c "update vdc_options set option_value = 'ca.pem' where option_name  = 'CACertificatePath';"
 psql engine postgres -c "update vdc_options set option_value = '/etc/pki/engine/ca/.keystore' where option_name = 'keystoreUrl';"
 psql engine postgres -c "update vdc_options set option_value = '/etc/pki/engine//ca/private/ca.pem' where option_name = 'CAEngineKey';"
