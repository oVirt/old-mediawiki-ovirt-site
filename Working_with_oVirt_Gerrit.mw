=== registering as a user ===
- you can use any OpenID provider for now[1]
- login page shows google and yahoo
- any fedora FAS account can login as well via 
https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/openid/id/<username>

=== set ssh keys in gerrit settings ===
- on your local machine, create a set of ssh keys if you don't have one via 
<nowiki>
'ssh-keygen -t rsa'
</nowiki>
- update via gerrit settings the ssh public key to allow ssh to gerrit

=== define gerrit in ~/.ssh/config ===
<nowiki>
Host gerrit.ovirt.org
   HostName gerrit.ovirt.org
   Port 29418
   User <username>
</nowiki>

=== check ssh works correctly, verify and ack the host fingerprint ===
<nowiki>
ssh gerrit.ovirt.org
</nowiki>
if you get this, it is fine:
***    Welcome to Gerrit Code Review    ****

=== cloning the repo ===
<nowiki>
git clone gerrit.ovirt.org:ovirt-engine
</nowiki>

this can be done without registering to gerrit using:
<nowiki>
git clone git://gerrit.ovirt.org/ovirt-engine
</nowiki>
=== install the change-Id hook ===
'''you must do this before you commit anything'''
<nowiki>
scp -p gerrit.ovirt.org:hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/
</nowiki>

=== rebase ===
<nowiki>
git fetch gerrit.ovirt.org:ovirt-engine master
</nowiki>

=== push your patch for review ===
<nowiki>
git push gerrit.ovirt.org:ovirt-engine HEAD:refs/for/master
</nowiki>

=== track patch review process ===
the review process is comprised of:
- anyone can send a patch
- anyone can code review and comment on the patch and +1/-1. This helps maintainers in reviewing the patches.
- a maintainer can code review it with +2 it, which is required to commit (submit) it.
- someone (anyone) needs to confirm they checked the patch works and flag it as verified +1
- a maintainer can submit (commit) the patch when it has:
   Code Review: +2
   Verified: +1
- nacked (-1) patches should not be submitted
- a submitted patch is merged to the git

[1] if anyone provides a reason to limit to specific OpenID providers that's an option as well.
