<code>RandomUtilsSeedingRule</code> is JUnit <code>@Rule</code> that allows better control of <code>RandomUtils</code>' random see in unit test environments. 

= Creating the Rule =
Like with any <code>@Rule</code>, the only thing you need to do in order to incorporate it in your test class is to declare a public member annotated with <code>@Rule</code>:

<pre>
@Rule
public RandomUtilsSeedingRule rusr = new RandomUtilsSeedingRule();
</pre>

= Loggin the Random Seed =
Now that you have the <code>RandomUtilsSeedingRule</code> defined, your test will automagically log the random seed it uses, e.g.:
<pre>
11:02:24,643 INFO  [RandomUtilsSeedingRule] Property "test.random.seed" was not set, using System.currentTimeMillis() as a seed.
11:02:24,644 INFO  [RandomUtilsSeedingRule] Running test with random seed: 1337155344644
</pre>

Note that this is done using oVirt's standard LogFactory and Log, so make sure you configure the logging in your project.

= Injecting a Random Seed =
Once you have a failed test due to a specific random input, you would probably want to reproduce it.
This can be done by specifying the environment variable <code>test.random.seed</code>.

You can make sure the injection worked properly by examining the log.
If, for example, you set <code>test.random.seed=123</code>, your output should look like this:
<pre>
11:11:53,159 INFO  [RandomUtilsSeedingRule] Running test with random seed: 123
</pre>
