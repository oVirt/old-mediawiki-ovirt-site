=== Summary ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
The aim of this feature is to enhance the engine setup being able to install and configure the WebSocketProxy on a second machine, where engine does not run, in a fully automated way.

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
The noVNC client used for VM web console utilizes websockets for passing VNC data. However, VNC server in qemu doesn't support websockets natively and there must be a websocket proxy placed between the client and VNC server. This proxy can run either on any node that has access to the host network but, currently, the engine-setup is only able to install and configure the WebSocketProxy on the node that runs the engine.

It's currently already possible run the WebSocketProxy  on a separate host but it requires a manual procedure [http://www.ovirt.org/Features/noVNC_console#Setup_Websocket_Proxy_on_a_Separate_Machine]. What we are proposing will automate the setup process so it will be configurable just using engine-setup command.
The engine-setup process will be updated asking (both in the interactive way and in the answer file) for the details (fqdn, port) of the machine that will run the WebSocketProxy.

Engine setup currently asks:
'Configure websocket proxy on the machine' accepting

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
The installation process will become easier for who needs to install the WebSocketProxy on a separate engine cause it will not require any successive manual procedure.

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->
The WebSocketProxy is already able to run on a different host, only the engine setup should be improved to allow it being automatically configured.  

=== Documentation / External references ===
<!-- Is there upstream documentation on this feature, or notes you have written yourself?  Link to that material here so other interested developers can get involved. Links to RFEs. -->
* [RFE] Allow setup of ovirt-websocket-proxy on separate machine - [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1080992]
* [RFE] rhevm-websocket-proxy - using as standalone service - automatic configuration - [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=985945]

=== Testing ===
A tester should perform a full oVirt installation choosing to install the WebSocketProxy on a different host. The The tester should be able to connect to any running machine via the noVNC web client.
