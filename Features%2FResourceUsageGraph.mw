= Resource Usage Graph =
 
== Summary ==
Implement a line chart showing a short history of the resource usage.

== Current status ==
* Target Release: 3.6
* Status: posted

== Background ==
Up until now, the resource (CPU, memory, network) usage of the VM was shown only as a current state with no historical view. 

It would be good to replace the current visualization with a line chart.

== Implementation ==
To store the short term history the vm_statistics table has been enriched by the following fields:
* cpu_usage_history
* memory_usage_history
* network_usage_history

This fields are defined as TEXT and the values in them are stored as one comma separated string of values in percentage, for example: "19,20,34,0,0,1"

The amount of values which are stored in this fields are regulated by '''UsageHistoryLimit'''' from '''vdc_options'''. For example, if the UsageHistoryLimit is 3 and the current value is "1,2,3" and the new value of 4 comes, the result will be "2,3,4".

== Frontend ==
A line chart will be added (implemented using the HTML5 canvas with a fallback to the old way of visualizing if the browser does not support it)
The widget's specific behavior (in case the browser supports HTML5 canvas):
* the widget draws a line chart ending with a green triangle (if the last value is smaller than 70), orange square (if smaller than 95) and a red dot (if bigger than 95)
* next to the chart is a the last value of the chart written in form of N% (e.g. 75%). If the value is >= 95, it is red and bold
* if the num of progress values is smaller than the amount fitting into the drawing area but does not start with 0, the values are prepended by '0' e.g. the chart will start from 0    
* if the num of progress values is bigger than the amount fitting into the drawing area, beginning of the values are cut        
* the distance between two points has to be between the 4px and 15px (calculated according to the width of the drawing area and num of of points in the chart) -  e.g. the bigger the drawing area the more points can fit in. It will also react to table column resize.
* if no points fit into the drawing area, only the number is shown

Please see the mockup attached (please note that the line endings are random in the mockup):
