== Detailed Description ==

Support managing the following gluster async tasks from the oVirt UI
* rebalance volume

User should be able to start any of these tasks as follows:
* Select a volume and click on the button "Start Rebalance"
* Select a brick and click on the button "Replace"
* When removing a brick, select/un-select a checkbox "Retain data". If selected, the remove brick operation should be triggered in asynchronous fashion. If not,  it should be performed in a synchronous way by passing the "force" option to "gluster volume remove-brick" command
