= Introduction =
Networking in oVirt comprises of several layers:
* The logical network definition (Data center + cluster network)
* The actual implementation  (The host level)
* The usage of the network (vNIC profiles + vNICs)

This document will try to cover the various networking aspects and some basic usages.

== The Data Center Networks ==
The first and foremost container of a network is the data center. The data center's networks are modelled under the data center (in the system tree and main tabs).
In this scope, each network must have a unique name and a unique VLAN tag (if it's used).

The availabke fields of a network entity represent the L2 properties that can be set on the network:
* Name - used to identify the network (propogates to the hosts)
* VLAN tag - If selected, the specific VLAN tag to use, otherwise traffic is untagged (No 802.1Q field in the frame header)
* VM network - If selected, the network can be consumed by VMs (via vNIC profiles), otherwise it is not consumable by VMs (See hosts section for more details)
* MTU - If specified, this MTU will be used, otherwise the OS default (usually 1500) of the host is used

Optionally, it's possible to export the network to an external provider upon creation. This topic is covered by the [[Features/Detailed_OSN_Integration]] feature and includes extra configuration to work.
