=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
Currently oVirt engine can assign a disk image to a single VM.<BR>
There are many use cases which requires concurrent access for disk, such as supporting clustered environment or support Databases with shared table-space<BR/>
The feature should provide the user the ability to manage share disk for multiple VMs that can handle concurrent access to a shared disk without risk of corruption.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
The feature enables shared disk, which is highly relevant for integrating clustered external application with oVirt distribution.
Databases with shared table-space will also be supported from now on.


=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->
Attaching shared disk will not consume new Quota resource.
Affected oVirt projects:
* API
* CLI
* Engine-core
* Webadmin
* User Portal
