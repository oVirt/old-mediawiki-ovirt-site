= First Release =
== Timeline ==
* oVirt first release is currently scheduled to '''2011-12-15'''.
** Versioned git branch creation: '''2011-12-13''' (??)
** Components maintainers '''MUST''' send their release notes prior to the new branch creation.

== Requirements  ==
* '''MUST''': Appropriate tag/branch in the git repos
* '''MUST''': Downloadable source tarball (signed)
* '''SHOULD''': Downloadable binary tarball
* '''SHOULD''': Downloadable binary builds for different distros
* '''MUST''': Easy SSL support (via instller or separate script)
* '''MUST''': Easy DB creation  (via instller or separate script)
* '''SHOULD''': Easy installation method (ovirt-setup or ovirt service)
* '''MUST''': Pass minimal smoke test
** Running a VM on NFS and Local storage sounds reasonable to me (oschreib)
** '''MUST''': ovirt-node full cycle (register, approve and running VM)

== Gaps ==
* '''setup process''':
** Missing SSL support
** No installer solution available yet
** '''ETA''': 2011-12-07 (depends on the chosen solution)
* '''ovirt-node''':
** VDSM Doesn't register without manual process (http://ovirt.org/wiki/Engine_Node_Integration#Engine_core_machine)
*** Patches posted, awaiting approval
** '''ETA''': Dependent on VDSM, but should be by 2011-12-09

== Open issues ==
* '''Versioning''': What will be oVirt's first release version? 3.1.0-1, 0.0.1-1, 4.0.0-1?
* '''Upgrade''': Should we support upgrade in the first release?
* '''JBoss''':Which JBoss version should we support?
** Currently, only JBoss AS5 is available (self created rpm from their zip)
* '''Signing''': Who should sign tarballs?
* '''ovirt-engine-config'': Broken due to https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=759094
