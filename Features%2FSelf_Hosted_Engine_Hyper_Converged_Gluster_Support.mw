{{Feature|name=Self Hosted Engine Hyper Converged Gluster Support|modules=ovirt-hosted-engine-setup|status=POST|version=3.6.0}}

== Summary ==
This feature enable the user to use Hyper Converged Gluster storage for Hosted Engine data domain.

== Detailed Description ==
==== UX changes ====
Using an existing Gluster storage:

          --== STORAGE CONFIGURATION ==--
         
          During customization use CTRL-D to abort.
          Please specify the storage you would like to use (glusterfs, iscsi, nfs3, nfs4)[nfs3]: glusterfs 
          Do you want to configure this host for providing GlusterFS storage? (Yes, No)[No]:
          Please note that Replica 3 support is required for the shared storage. 
          Please specify the full shared storage connection path to use (example: host:/path): 192.168.1.107:/hosted_engine_glusterfs

Provisioning Gluster storage on the same host for Hyper Converged support:

          --== STORAGE CONFIGURATION ==--
         
          During customization use CTRL-D to abort.
          Please specify the storage you would like to use (glusterfs, iscsi, nfs3, nfs4)[nfs3]: glusterfs
          Do you want to configure this host for providing GlusterFS storage? (Yes, No)[No]: yes
          Please provide the path to be used for creating the brick (/path): /he
          Further instructions are available on ....

==== Config files changes ====

According to http://www.ovirt.org/Features/GlusterFS_Storage_Domain#Important_Pre-requisites the only required change is to add
  option rpc-auth-allow-insecure on
to '''''/etc/glusterfs/glusterd.vol'''''

By default gluster uses a port that vdsm also wants, so we need to change base-port setting avoiding the clash between the two daemons. We need to add
  option base-port 49217
to '''''/etc/glusterfs/glusterd.vol'''''

and ensure glusterd service is enabled and started before proceeding.

==== VDSM commands involved ====
* glusterVolumesList
* glusterVolumeCreate
* glusterVolumeSet
* glusterTasksList
* glusterVolumeStart

The rest is quite similar to GlusterFS storage.

== Benefit to oVirt ==
Users will be able to use Gluster Hyper Converged storage as data domain for Hosted Engine.
