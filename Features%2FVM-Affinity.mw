== Summary ==
The oVirt scheduler capabilities introduced in version 3.3 have opened opportunities to enhance how VM Workloads are scheduled to run within a cluster.  By using the filtering and weighing mechanisms introduced in the Scheduler, it is now possible to apply Affinity and Anti-Affinity rules to VMs to manually dictate scenarios in which VMs should run together on the same, or separately on different hypervisor hosts.
