===Summary ===
Network Quality of Service feature will be added to oVirt from version 3.3 and will support cluster version 3.3 or higher.<br />
The feature will allow the user to limit the inbound and outbound network traffic in virtual NIC level.<br />
In order to define more natural coupling of the QoS to a VNIC we define a new concept called '''VNIC Profile'''. The VNIC profile will be introduced in oVirt 3.3 to all clusters and will wrap few of the properties currently defined directly on the VNIC

=== Detailed Description  ===
==== QoS ====
Traffic shaping is a very common practice in network management. Traffic shaping allows the network administrator to prevent over consumption of network resources by limiting the bandwidth in several layers. Current implementation of libvirt allows limiting the bandwidth in the virtual NIC level for both inbound and outbound traffic. The Network QoS on oVirt make use of that API and allows the network administrator to define network limitations on specific VNICs.      

The QoS properties are properties which defines the traffic shaping applied on the virtual NIC . QoS properties currently include:
* Inbound
** Average - long-term limit around which  traffic should float (Mbps)
** Peak - the maximum allowed bandwidth during burst (Mbps) 
** Burst - The burst size (Mb)
*Outbound
** Average - long-term limit around which  traffic should float (Mbps)
** Peak - the maximum allowed bandwidth during burst (Mbps) 
** Burst - The burst size (Mb)
For example:  if average is set to 100 units, peak to 200 and burst to 50, after sending those 50 units of data at rate 200, the rate will fall down to 100.

Traffic shaping using the Network QoS feature will be available only for oVirt networks at this stage. Externally provided networks (such as Quantum) may be supported in future extensions.

==== VNIC Profile ====
The VNIC Profile concept embodies a predefined package of network setting  which will define the network service a VNIC will get.<br />
VNIC Profile include:<br />
* Profile name
* Network
* Quality of Service
* Port mirroring
* Custom properties

When creating a new VNIC or editing an existing one the user will select a VNIC Profile (instead of the current implementation in which the user selects a network and sets port mirroring and custom properties).<br />
The network administrator could create several VNIC Profiles for each network. He could then grant a users with the permission to use (consume) each profile. The user will only be able to use profiles which he was granted access to. 

:For example: the network admin will create two VNIC profiles for network "blue": 
::Profile "Gold" - with better QoS and no port mirroring  
::Profile "Silver" with lower QoS and enabled port mirroring. 
:He will then define the user-group "students" as user of profile "Silver" and user-group "teachers" as user of profile "Gold". In this case the teachers will enjoy better quality of service then the students. When a teacher will add/edit a virtual NIC he could select profile "Gold" for that NIC - the VNIC will be connected to network "blue" with high QoS and no port mirroring. 

The VNIC Profile could be edited by the network administrator at any time. The changes will seep down to all VNICs using the profile. In case VNIC using the edited profile are connected to running VMs the change will apply only on the VM next run. The engine will retrieve the actual configuration of the profile properties on the VNIC from VDSM (using the network statistics mechanism) and the networked administrator will be presented with the state of each VNIC (synched/unsynched).

Hotplug  and Dynamically Rewire will continue to be fully supported. Devices which will be hotpluged or rewired will use the updated profile connected to the VNIC. 

When a Template is created from a VM the VNIC Profile will be kept along with the VNIC. When a VM is created from template the VNIC Profiles will be taken from the template's VNICs.

VNIC Profiles could not be deleted from the engine as long as one or more VM/Templates are using those profiles.

The VNIC Profiles will be exported and imported together with the VNIC. If the user will import a VM which is using a profile not exist in the system, he will be notified and the VNIC will be connected to a default minimal profile defined in the system.

In 3.2 or lower clusters versions not all of the profile properties are supported. in those clusters only Profile name, Network and Port mirroring will be enabled.

=== Benefit to oVirt  ===
We would like to expose to the user the ability to configure the Network Quality of Service (QoS) properties of each virtual NIC. The Network QoS feature will add this ability to the engine. The VNIC profile will improve the usability of the network configuration on the VM. On the user side - VNIC profiles will allow the user to configure a VNIC in relative ease. On the network administrator side - VNIC Profiles will help the administrator to keep control of all the VNICs connected to the network in a simpler way.<br />
The combination of the two will allow the network admin to define, control and dispense different service levels to different users or groups (which may have different priorities).

= Design and Implementation =
The Network QoS feature includes two main parts:
* VNIC level QoS
* VNIC Profiles
The two parts will be developed in parallel 

see : [[http://www.ovirt.org/Features/Design/Network_QoS_-_detailed_design Implementation details]] for detailed design 
  
== VNIC level QoS ==
=== GUI ===
The UI for setting of  QoS properties will be added to the Add/Edit Profile dialog.<br />

'''Add/Edit Profile dialog'''<br />
[[File:Vnic_profile.png]]

The network administrator could enable/disable the QoS properties (for each inbound / outbound).  Disabled QoS will mean no limitation on the traffic in this direction<br />
Once inbound/outbound was enabled all three field must be filled (This will be verified before allowing to close the dialog).<br />

=== Backend ===
We define a new entity called "NetworkQoS" - the QoS properties will be contained in this object.
A NetworkQoS object will be added to NetworkProfile entity.<br />
see : [[http://www.ovirt.org/Features/Design/Network_QoS_-_detailed_design Implementation details]] for detailed design

=== DB Change ===
Add NetworkQoS table.<br />
see : [[http://www.ovirt.org/Features/Design/Network_QoS_-_detailed_design Implementation details]] for detailed design

=== REST API ===
Not supported in this version

=== VDSM ===
libvirt version 1.0.1 or higher is required to enable the QoS feature (vdsm 3.3 will use higher version). 
* Add support of QoS properties in VDSM API: run VM, hot plug and update VM device verbs (update in schema) 
* Add support in the vnic object and the vnic to_xml()

see : [[http://www.ovirt.org/Features/Design/Network_QoS_-_detailed_design Implementation details]] for detailed design

== VNIC Profiles ==
=== Upgrade ===
In the upgrade process we will do the following:
* Create a VNIC profile for each network, without port mirroring
* Create a VNIC profile with port mirroring for every network which has a VNIC with port mirroring
* A VNIC connected to a network x in 3.2 will automatically be connected to the correlating profile in 3.3 (according to the port mirroring settings).
* Comment: when we say VNIC we mean either a VM VNIC or a Template VNIC
* A user which had a permission to use a network in 3.2 will be granted the permission to use the correlating profile in 3.3 (according to the port mirroring settings).

=== Permissions ===
The following action groups will be added:
* CONFIGURE_NETWORK_VNIC_PROFILE - will be part of roles that have the CONFIGURE_STORAGE_POOL_NETWORK action group
* CREATE_NETWORK_VNIC_PROFILE - will be part of roles that have the CREATE_STORAGE_POOL_NETWORK action group
* DELETE_NETWORK_VNIC_PROFILE - will be part of roles that have the DELETE_STORAGE_POOL_NETWORK action group

A VNICProfileUser role will be added, with the following action groups:
* CONFIGURE_VM_NETWORK
* CONFIGURE_TEMPLATE_NETWORK
* LOGIN

On upgrade of the permissions, we will do the following:
* Remove the

=== GUI (VNIC Profiles) ===
A new sub tab will be added to the Network main tab (positioned second, after General)<br />
The sub tab will show the available Profiles for each network. Columns will be: 
* Name - string
* Port Mirroring - Boolean 
* Inbound QoS - formatted string
* outbound QoS - formatted string<br />
supported actions: add, edit, remove

The sub tab will include a right pane which will hold "Permissions"/"Consumers" tab where the user will define the user which can use the selected profile.<br />
supported action: add / remove

In The Virtual Machine sub-tab (under the Network main tab) "Profile" column will be added to the table. <br />

'''Profiles sub tab'''<br />
[[File:Network_profiles.png]]

A new dialog will be created for add/edit profile. the dialog will include the following fields:
* Name (text box) 
* Port mirroring (check box) 
* Inbound QoS (3 text boxes) 
* Outbound QoS (3 text boxes) 
* Custom properties (Selection box and +/- buttons) <br />
- In clusters supporting version 3.2 or lower the QoS and Custom properties fields will be visible but disabled.


'''Add/Edit Profile dialog"<br />
[[File:Vnic_profile.png]]

The Add/Edit VNIC dialog will be added a Profile selection box.<br />
The network which will be available for selection in the Network selection box will only be networks which the user have a permission to use at least on of their profiles.<br />   
After selecting a network the Profile selection box will be populated with all profiles of the selected network which the user have permission to use.

'''Profile Selection'''<br />
[[File:Profile_selection.png]]

=== Permissions ===
In current implementation two roles are defined for networks:
* NetworkAdmin - can create/remove/edit/assign to cluster/configure for VM/ configure for Template on '''Network''' entity
* NetworkUser - can configure for VM/configure for Template on '''Network''' entity

In The new implementation:
* NetworkAdmin - can create/remove/edit/assign to cluster/configure for VM/ configure for Template on '''Network''' entity
* NetworkAdmin - can create/remove/edit/configure for VM/configure for Template on '''VNICProfile''' entity
* NetworkUser - can configure for VM/configure for Template on '''VNICProfile''' entity
* [Optional] NetworkUser - can configure for VM/configure for Template on '''Network''' entity - this will allow the NetworkUser to use any VNICProfile attached to this Network

NetworkAdmin permissions on '''VNICProfile''' entity will be added in the upgrade process.<br />
NetworkUser permission on '''Network''' entity will be changed to permissions on '''VNICProfile''' entity in the upgrade process<br />


=== Backend ===
We define a new entity: NetworkProfile.<br />
The NetworkProfile will be added as a property of NetworkInterface.
