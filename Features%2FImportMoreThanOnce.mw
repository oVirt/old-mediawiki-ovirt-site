* Design Stage
* Last updated date: Sun Feb Wed Nov 19 2012

=== Affected oVirt projects: ===
* Core
* Webadmin
* API/CLI

== Design ==

note: unless specified 'entity' may refer both to VM and Template oVirt Entities.

=== Core: ===
* Add to ImportEntityParameter parameter class boolean member that indicates whether this entity should be cloned, the default value is false.
* Alter ImportEntityCommand in case clone parameter field is set to true:
:* Set the VM with a new identifier (the new name already placed in the vm - concat of vm and suffix).
:* Set the disks target with a new identifier.
:* For all VM's nics, allocate new MAC address.
:* (in import VM) Collape all snapshots must be true.

* detailed design will be added in the near future.

=== webadmin ===

Only the ImportEntity dialog will be affected:

* Add 'Already Exists in Setup' column to import entity dialog:
:* Run multiple queries for get_entity_by_id to check wheater the imported entities exists in the setup.
* Add 'clone all entities' check box to Import Entity Dialog
:* (in import VM) In case it's checked the 'collapse all snapshots' checkbox should be checked and disabled.
:* In case it's checked a suffix textbox should be added (the suffix will be added to all VMs names).
* Add 'clone only existing entities' check box to Import Entity Dialog:
:* (in import VM) In case it's checked a label will be shown to user that marks that the cloned VMs snapshots will be collapsed.
:* In case it's checked a suffix textbox should be added (the suffix will be added to all VMs names).
:* If 'clone all entities' is checked 'clone only existing entities' will be checked and disabled.
