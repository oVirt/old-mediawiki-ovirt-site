= Import VM or Template More than Once Feature =

== Owner ==
* Name: [[User:gchaplik| Gilad Chaplik]]
* Email: <gchaplik@redhat.com>

== Summary ==
Adding the functionality to import VMs and Templates that already exist in setup, 
in fact this feature consists of changing the identifiers of an imported VM/Template.

=== Current status ===
* Design Stage
* Last updated date: Tue Feb 21 2012

=== Affected oVirt projects: ===
* Core
* Webadmin
* API/CLI

=== Limitations ===

* Cannot import VM without collapsing its snapshots.

== Design ==

note: unless specified 'entity' may refer both to VM and Template oVirt Entities.

=== Core ===
* Add to ImportEntityParameter parameter class boolean member that indicates whether this entity should be cloned, the default value is false.
* Alter ImportEntityCommand in case clone parameter field is set to true:
:* Set the VM with a new identifier (the new name already placed in the vm - concat of vm and suffix, see webadmin).
:* Set the disks target with a new identifier.
:* For all VM's NICs, allocate new MAC addresses.
:* (in import VM) Collape all snapshots must be 'true'.

* detailed design will be added in the near future.

=== webadmin ===

Only the ImportEntity dialog will be affected:

* Add 'Already Exists in Setup' column to import entity dialog:
:* Run multiple queries for get_entity_by_id to check whether the imported entities exist in the setup.
* Add 'clone all entities' check box to Import Entity Dialog
:* In case checked:
::* (in import VM) The 'collapse all snapshots' checkbox should be checked and disabled.
::* A suffix textbox should be added (the suffix will be added to all VMs' names).
* Add 'clone only existing entities' check box to Import Entity Dialog:
:* In case checked: 
::* (in import VM) A label will be shown to user that indicates that the cloned VMs' snapshots will be collapsed.
::* A suffix textbox should be added (the suffix will be added to all VMs names).
:* If 'clone all entities' is checked, 'clone only existing entities' will be checked and disabled.

* the suffix text box will be shown only when one of the above check-boxes is checked (it is relevant only for importing an entity as clone).

==== mockups ====
note: the following mockups are of ImportVM, in ImportTemplate the 'Collapse Snapshot' check box is hidden, and also any label that is relevant to it.

* in case no entity exists in the system, this is the default view of the dialog:
[[File:Nothing_selected.png]]

* in case one of the entities already exists- the duplicate check box will be shown. its default is 'true':
[[File:Only_dup_selected.png]]

* when selecting 'clone all' the duplicate check box (if shown) will be check and disabled:
[[File:Clone_all_selected.png]]



=== CLI/API ===

Adding 'clone' parameter (not madnatory) and then getting it from Action.java in BackendStorageDomainVmResource-->doImport(), then setting in ImportVmParameters and before sending to Backend (if it's null, this means false). 

For import VM:

    http://localhost:8080/api/storagedomains/19290426-6681-479b-bd8e-76b54d1b1489/vms/we958723498579234/import
    
    <action>
       <cluster id="afsdasdf"/>
       <storage_domain id="5@#$^234634^"/>
       <clone>true</clone>     //This is the new value
       <vm>
          <name>new_name</name>
       </vm>
    </action> 

Same for template in: BackendStorageDomainTemplateResource


And finally, add in RSDL (rsdl_metadata_v-3.1.yaml): 
optionalArguments: {action.clone: 'xs:boolean'} (for both VM and Template import command)



*SDK and CLI should be automatically updated, as they are auto-generated from REST-API.
