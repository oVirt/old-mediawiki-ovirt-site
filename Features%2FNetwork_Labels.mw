=== Detailed Description ===
In our oVirt installation we are going to have a lot of Networks/VLAN's in a cluster. This means that when adding a host to this cluster, it means a lot of work adding all the different networks. 
Also, when adding a logical network, it means a lot of work adding the network to all the hosts.

Giving a label to the networks and the host's nics will simplify these use cases.
When adding  a new host- the user will need just to set labels on host's physical interfaces.
When adding a network - the user will need just to set label on the network.

For example if the labels are:
<pre>
NIC A
NIC B
NIC C
</pre>

On host1 it can be specified for instance:
<pre>
eth0 = NIC A
eth1 = NIC C
eth2 = NIC B
</pre>

And on host2:
<pre>
bond0 = NIC A
eth0 = NIC B
eth1 = NIC C
</pre>

And for  vlan10   for example assign <tt>NIC A</tt> => all hosts in the cluster will have vlan10 assigned to the right nic (with <tt>NIC A</tt> label), without having to add it manually to all the hosts in the cluster.

=== GUI changes ===
* Cluster Network sub tab
** Adding command- Assign network to hosts  (available on single and multiple selection)
** Assign/Unassign Networks
*** Adding a new column named "Label" (When Editing (double click) will show a suggest box otherwise will show the label name). (The suggest box will show already used network labels and will allow to add a new label ).
* Network Cluster sub tab
** Adding command- Assign network to hosts  (available on single selection)
** Assign/Unassign Network
*** Adding a new column named "Label" (When Editing (double click) will show a suggest box otherwise will show the label name). 
* Host Network interfaces sub tab
** Adding command- Assign all networks
** Setup Networks dialog
*** Add Edit command on  nic
**** Add table with 2 columns - 1. label (suggest box on editing) and 2. assign all networks check box (with header for assign all).
*** Edit bond
**** Same as edit nic.
* Network Host sub tab
** Setup Networks dialog - same as for Host Network interfaces sub tab.
