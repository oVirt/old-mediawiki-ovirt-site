== Network Lables ==

=== Summary ===
* ability to flag a physical interface/bond with a label
* ability to flag a logical network with a label
* engine will automatically associate the logical network with the physical 
* interface on all hosts in cluser with same label.
* tbd: when are hosts updated/sync'd with the configuration (automatic or manual).

=== Detailed Description ===
In our RHEV installation we are going to have a lot of VLAN's in a
cluster. This means that when adding a host to this cluster, it means a
lot of work adding all the different networks. Also, when adding a VLAN,
it means a lot of work adding the VLAN to all the hosts.

It would be a good feature to be able to have a host profile, where you
have:
NIC A
NIC B
NIC C

On host1 you then specify for instance:
eth0 = NIC A
eth1 = NIC C
eth2 = NIC B
And on host2:
bond0 = NIC A
eth0 = NIC B
eth1 = NIC C

And then you assign a VLAN to for example NIC A, and all hosts in the
cluster will have that VLAN assigned to the right NIC, without having to
add it to all the hosts in the cluster

3) Business Requirements Satisfied By Request:
"We offer a Virtual DataCenter to our customors, based on RHEV, but with
our own gui that connect through an api. For each customer we will have at
least 2 VLAN's, this will mean a lot of vlan's.
Suppose we have 30 hosts, and 60 vlans.
- Now we add host 31, we will have to add all 60 VLANS to host 31. That is
a lot of clicking in the gui.
- we get a new customer, and add 2 vlans: on all 31 hosts we need to add
those 2 vlans, again a lot of work.

with my proposal:
add host 31:
map physical interfaces to host profile interfaces and you are done.
add customer:
add 2 vlans to a NIC in host profile and you are done."
