== Network Lables ==

=== Summary ===
* ability to flag a physical interface/bond with a label
* ability to flag a logical network with a label
* engine will automatically associate the logical network with the physical 
* interface on all hosts in cluser with same label.
* tbd: when are hosts updated/sync'd with the configuration (automatic or manual).

=== Detailed Description ===
In our RHEV installation we are going to have a lot of  Networks/VLAN's in a cluster. This means that when adding a host to this cluster, it means a lot of work adding all the different networks. 
Also, when adding a logical network, it means a lot of work adding the network to all the hosts.

Giving a label to the networks and the host's nics will simplify these use cases.
When adding  a new host- the user will need just to set labels on host's physical interfaces.
When adding a network - the user will need just to set label on the network.

For example if the labels are:
NIC A
NIC B
NIC C

On host1 it can be specified for instance:
eth0 = NIC A
eth1 = NIC C
eth2 = NIC B

And on host2:
bond0 = NIC A
eth0 = NIC B
eth1 = NIC C

And for  vlan10   for example assign NIC A => all hosts in the cluster will have vlan10 assigned to the right nic (with NIC A label), without having to add it manually to all the hosts in the cluster.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
Simplify the process of adding a new host and  new network to the cluster.
