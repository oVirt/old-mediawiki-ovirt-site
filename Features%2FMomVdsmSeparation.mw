{{Feature|name=Starting MOM as a separate process instead of VDSM threa|modules=vdsm,mom|status=Draft|version=3.6.0}}

== Summary ==
MOM is moving to be used as a standalone process again because of some VDSM performance issues caused by a number of threads.

== Detailed Description ==


=== The proposed changes ===

* The RPC port will be enabled in MOM
* MOM will be started using new systemd service (mom-vdsm) provided by VDSM
* the service file will also configure MOM to use the config files and policy dir provided by VDSM
* VDSM will use the RPC port to talk to MOM (UpdateMomPolicy)
* KsmTune command needs to be added to the VDSM's API
* MOM will use either XML-RPC or json-RPC to talk to VDSM
* MOM will cache the results of getAllVmStats instead of asking for stats per VM

== Testing ==



== Contingency Plan ==

We can tweak the config file (/etc/vdsm/mom.conf) values to use 15 second period for all loops. That provides a huge improvement on the test (120 CPUs) machine.

We want to ship mom as a separate process as new default in 3.6. However, old code will be kept, so it will be possible to run MOM as VDSM thread with manual configuration,
obtaining the same behaviour as in oVirt 3.5.x.

Instructions to reconfigure MOM to run as VDSM thread will be provided on this page.
