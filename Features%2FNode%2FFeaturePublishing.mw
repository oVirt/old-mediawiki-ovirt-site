== Feature Publishing <!-- The name of your feature --> ==

=== Summary ===
<!-- A sentence or two summarizing what this feature is and what it will do.  This information is used for the overall feature summary page for each release. -->
Feature publishing shall help thrid parties (e.g. plugins or management systems) to discover the features of a Node.
The framework specifies a way to register features. The publishing is separate and can happen e.g. via http, mdns or by ssh-ing into a Node.

=== Current status ===
<!-- * Link to feature page in a specific release. That release may complete the feature, or parts of it. The complete scope of this feature in this release will be described in the release feature page -->
* Status: '''In progress'''

=== Detailed Description ===
<!-- Expand on the summary, if appropriate.  A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better. -->
Currently there is no defined way to determin what features (or packages) a node supports (or includes).
By adding a feature registry we address this point. This shall give thrd parties (like plugins) the ability to register themselves and their features.
Another party can then query this feature registry to find out about the features supported by a specific Node.

=== Benefit to oVirt ===
<!-- What is the benefit to the oVirt project?  If this is a major capability update, what has changed?  If this is a new feature, what capabilities does it bring? Why will oVirt become a better distribution or project because of this feature?-->
This is a solution to differentiate Nodes (wrt their functionality) as Nodes with different features popup (e.g. VDSM or OpenStack support).

=== Dependencies / Related Features ===
<!-- What other packages depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, completion of another feature owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate? Other Features that might get affected by this feature? -->

* Affected Packages
** ovirt-node


=== Testing ===
TBD

=== Documentation / External references ===
<!-- Is there upstream documentation on this feature, or notes you have written yourself?  Link to that material here so other interested developers can get involved. Links to RFEs. -->
